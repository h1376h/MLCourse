## Solution

We'll work through each task systematically, building a complete understanding of SVM theory through practical application.

### Task 1: Dataset Design with Exactly 3 Support Vectors

**Design Strategy:**
To achieve exactly 3 support vectors with 6 points (3 per class), we need:
- 3 points lying exactly on the margin boundaries (support vectors)
- 3 points lying strictly inside the margins (non-support vectors)

**Designed Dataset:**
- **Positive class**: $(3,3)$, $(4,4)$, $(5,2)$
- **Negative class**: $(1,1)$, $(0,2)$, $(2,0)$

**Verification Results:**
- Number of support vectors: **3** ✓
- Support vector indices: $[4, 5, 0]$
- Support vectors:
  - Point 4: $(0,2)$, label = -1
  - Point 5: $(2,0)$, label = -1  
  - Point 0: $(3,3)$, label = +1

**Key Insight:** The design successfully achieves the target of exactly 3 support vectors, with one from the positive class and two from the negative class.

### Task 2: Analytical Solution

**Optimization Problem:**
$$\min_{\mathbf{w}, b} \frac{1}{2}\|\mathbf{w}\|^2$$
$$\text{subject to: } y_i(\mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{x}_i + b) \geq 1, \quad i = 1, \ldots, 6$$

**Solution:**
- **Weight vector**: $\mathbf{w}^* = [0.4998, 0.4998]$
- **Bias term**: $b^* = -1.9995$
- **Decision boundary**: $0.4998x_1 + 0.4998x_2 - 1.9995 = 0$

**Support Vector Constraints:**
For the 3 support vectors, the constraints are active:
- Point 4 $(0,2)$: $-1 \times (0.500 \times 0 + 0.500 \times 2 - 1.999) = 1$ ✓
- Point 5 $(2,0)$: $-1 \times (0.500 \times 2 + 0.500 \times 0 - 1.999) = 1$ ✓
- Point 0 $(3,3)$: $+1 \times (0.500 \times 3 + 0.500 \times 3 - 1.999) = 1$ ✓

**Margin Analysis:**
All points satisfy the margin constraints with margins ≥ 1:
- Support vectors: margin ≈ 1.000 (on boundary)
- Non-support vectors: margin > 1.000 (inside margin)

### Task 3: KKT Conditions Verification

The KKT conditions for SVM optimality are:

**1. Stationarity:** $\mathbf{w}^* = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i y_i \mathbf{x}_i$
- Original: $\mathbf{w} = [0.4998, 0.4998]$
- Reconstructed: $\mathbf{w} = [0.4998, 0.4998]$
- **Difference: 0.00000000** ✓

**2. Primal Feasibility:** $y_i(\mathbf{w}^{*T}\mathbf{x}_i + b^*) \geq 1$
- All 6 points satisfy the constraint ✓
- Minimum margin: 0.9996 ≈ 1.000

**3. Dual Feasibility:** $\alpha_i \geq 0$
- All Lagrange multipliers are non-negative ✓
- $\alpha$ values: $[0.2499, 0.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000, 0.1250, 0.1250]$

**4. Complementary Slackness:** $\alpha_i[y_i(\mathbf{w}^{*T}\mathbf{x}_i + b^*) - 1] = 0$
- Small numerical errors due to finite precision
- Conceptually satisfied (support vectors have $\alpha_i > 0$, non-support vectors have $\alpha_i = 0$)

**Overall:** KKT conditions are satisfied within numerical precision.

### Task 4: Generalization Bounds (VC Dimension Theory)

**Dataset Characteristics:**
- Number of samples: $n = 6$
- Number of features: $d = 2$
- VC dimension: $d + 1 = 3$
- Support vectors: $3$ out of $6$ points

**Generalization Bounds (95% confidence):**

**1. VC Bound:**
$$R(h) \leq R_{\text{emp}}(h) + \sqrt{\frac{VC \log\left(\frac{2n}{VC}\right) + \log\left(\frac{4}{\delta}\right)}{2n}}$$
$$R(h) \leq 0 + \sqrt{\frac{3 \log(4) + \log(80)}{12}} = 0.844$$

**2. Support Vector Bound:**
$$R(h) \leq \frac{\mathbb{E}[\text{\# support vectors}]}{n} = \frac{3}{6} = 0.500$$

**Interpretation:**
- **VC bound (84.4%)**: Very loose for small datasets
- **SV bound (50.0%)**: More informative, suggests reasonable generalization
- **Sparsity**: Only 50% of data points are support vectors, indicating good model complexity

### Task 5: Geometric Construction Comparison

**Geometric Approach:**
1. **Find closest points** between classes: $(3,3)$ and $(1,1)$
2. **Distance between closest points**: $2.828$
3. **Midpoint**: $(2.0, 2.0)$
4. **Normal vector**: $[0.7071, 0.7071]$ (normalized)
5. **Geometric bias**: $-2.8284$

**Comparison with Analytical Solution:**
- **Analytical (normalized)**: $\mathbf{w} = [0.7071, 0.7071]$, $b = -2.8286$
- **Geometric**: $\mathbf{w} = [0.7071, 0.7071]$, $b = -2.8284$
- **Difference**: $0.000151$ ✓

**Geometric Verification:**
- **Margin width**: $2.829$
- **Half margin**: $1.415$
- **Distance from closest points to hyperplane**: ≈ $1.414$
- **Consistency**: Excellent agreement between geometric and analytical approaches
