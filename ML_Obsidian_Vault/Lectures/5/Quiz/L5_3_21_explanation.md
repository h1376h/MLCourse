# Question 21: Feature Space Geometry

## Problem Statement
Analyze the geometry of feature spaces induced by different kernels.

### Task
1. For 2D input, describe the geometry of the feature space
2. For $(\mathbf{x}^T\mathbf{z} + 1)^2$ with 2D input, visualize the 6D feature space structure
3. Explain why RBF kernels correspond to infinite-dimensional feature spaces
4. Show that linear kernels preserve angles but RBF kernels don't
5. Prove that any finite dataset becomes separable in sufficiently high dimensions

## Understanding the Problem
Kernel methods in machine learning map input data to higher-dimensional feature spaces where linear relationships become more apparent. Different kernels induce different geometric structures in these feature spaces, which affects how the data can be separated and classified. Understanding these geometric properties is crucial for choosing appropriate kernels and interpreting their behavior.

## Solution

### Step 1: 2D Input Feature Space Geometry

For 2D input data, different kernels create distinct geometric structures in the feature space:

**Linear Kernel**: $K(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{z}) = \mathbf{x}^T\mathbf{z}$
- No transformation occurs; the feature space is identical to the input space
- Preserves all geometric relationships (distances, angles, linearity)
- Useful when data is already linearly separable

**Polynomial Kernel**: $K(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{z}) = (\mathbf{x}^T\mathbf{z} + 1)^d$
- Maps to a finite-dimensional feature space
- Introduces non-linear relationships while maintaining finite dimensionality
- Degree $d$ determines the complexity of the transformation

**RBF Kernel**: $K(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{z}) = \exp(-\gamma\|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{z}\|^2)$
- Maps to an infinite-dimensional feature space
- Creates highly non-linear decision boundaries
- Sensitive to local structure in the data

The visualization shows how different kernels transform the same 2D input points, creating distinct geometric structures in their respective feature spaces.

### Step 2: 6D Feature Space Structure for $(\mathbf{x}^T\mathbf{z} + 1)^2$

For the polynomial kernel $K(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{z}) = (\mathbf{x}^T\mathbf{z} + 1)^2$ with 2D input, we can explicitly construct the feature mapping:

$$\phi(\mathbf{x}) = [1, \sqrt{2}x_1, \sqrt{2}x_2, x_1^2, \sqrt{2}x_1x_2, x_2^2]^T$$

This maps 2D input to a 6D feature space. Let's verify this mapping:

**Sample 2D input points:**
```
x1 = [1, 2]
x2 = [3, 1] 
x3 = [2, 3]
x4 = [4, 2]
x5 = [1, 4]
```

**Transformed points in 6D feature space:**
```
phi(x1) = [1.0, 1.414, 2.828, 1.0, 2.828, 4.0]
phi(x2) = [1.0, 4.243, 1.414, 9.0, 4.243, 1.0]
phi(x3) = [1.0, 2.828, 4.243, 4.0, 8.485, 9.0]
phi(x4) = [1.0, 5.657, 2.828, 16.0, 11.314, 4.0]
phi(x5) = [1.0, 1.414, 5.657, 1.0, 5.657, 16.0]
```

**Kernel verification:**
```
K(x1, x2) = 36.000 = 36.000 ✓
K(x1, x3) = 81.000 = 81.000 ✓
K(x1, x4) = 81.000 = 81.000 ✓
K(x1, x5) = 100.000 = 100.000 ✓
K(x2, x3) = 100.000 = 100.000 ✓
K(x2, x4) = 225.000 = 225.000 ✓
K(x2, x5) = 64.000 = 64.000 ✓
K(x3, x4) = 225.000 = 225.000 ✓
K(x3, x5) = 225.000 = 225.000 ✓
K(x4, x5) = 169.000 = 169.000 ✓
```

The polynomial kernel successfully maps 2D points to a 6D space where linear separation becomes possible, while the kernel trick allows us to compute inner products in this high-dimensional space without explicitly constructing the feature vectors.

### Step 3: RBF Kernels and Infinite-Dimensional Feature Spaces

RBF kernels correspond to infinite-dimensional feature spaces due to their Taylor series expansion:

$$K(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{z}) = \exp(-\gamma\|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{z}\|^2) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{\gamma^n}{n!} (\mathbf{x}^T\mathbf{z})^n$$

**Demonstration with sample points:**
- Test points: $\mathbf{x} = [1, 2]$, $\mathbf{z} = [3, 1]$
- Exact RBF: $K(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{z}) = 0.006738$

**Taylor series approximation:**
```
Approximated RBF (1 terms): 1.000000
Approximated RBF (3 terms): 18.500000
Approximated RBF (5 terms): 65.375000
Approximated RBF (10 terms): 143.689457
```

The infinite series expansion shows that RBF kernels implicitly work in an infinite-dimensional feature space, where each term $(\mathbf{x}^T\mathbf{z})^n$ corresponds to a feature of degree $n$. This infinite dimensionality allows RBF kernels to capture highly complex, non-linear relationships in the data.

### Step 4: Angle Preservation in Linear vs RBF Kernels

**Test vectors:**
```
v1 = [1, 0]
v2 = [0, 1] 
v3 = [1, 1]
```

**Original angles:**
```
Angle between v1 and v2: 90.00°
Angle between v1 and v3: 45.00°
Angle between v2 and v3: 45.00°
```

**Linear kernel preserves angles:**
```
Linear kernel angle between v1 and v2: 90.00°
Linear kernel angle between v1 and v3: 45.00°
Linear kernel angle between v2 and v3: 45.00°
```

**RBF kernel doesn't preserve angles:**
```
RBF kernel angle between v1 and v2: 82.22°
RBF kernel angle between v1 and v3: 68.42°
RBF kernel angle between v2 and v3: 68.42°
```

**Mathematical explanation:**

For linear kernels: $K(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{z}) = \mathbf{x}^T\mathbf{z}$
- The cosine of the angle between vectors is: $\cos(\theta) = \frac{\mathbf{x}^T\mathbf{z}}{\|\mathbf{x}\|\|\mathbf{z}\|} = \frac{K(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{z})}{\sqrt{K(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x})K(\mathbf{z}, \mathbf{z})}}$
- Since $K(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}) = \|\mathbf{x}\|^2$, angles are preserved

For RBF kernels: $K(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{z}) = \exp(-\gamma\|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{z}\|^2)$
- The kernel value depends on the squared distance between points
- This non-linear transformation distorts angular relationships
- The cosine formula becomes: $\cos(\theta) = \frac{\exp(-\gamma\|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{z}\|^2)}{\sqrt{\exp(0)\exp(0)}} = \exp(-\gamma\|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{z}\|^2)$
- This clearly doesn't preserve the original angular relationships

### Step 5: Finite Dataset Separability in High Dimensions

**Theorem**: Any finite dataset becomes linearly separable in sufficiently high dimensions.

**Proof**: Consider a dataset with $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$. We can construct a mapping to $\mathbb{R}^n$ where each point becomes separable:

$$\phi(\mathbf{x}_i) = [0, 0, \ldots, 1, \ldots, 0]^T$$

where the $1$ is in the $i$-th position. This creates a feature space where each point lies on a different axis, making them trivially separable.

**Experimental demonstration:**
- Created 20 points with circular decision boundary (non-linearly separable in 2D)
- Class distribution: 6 points in one class, 14 in another
- Tested separability in dimensions 2-8

**Results:**
```
Dimension 2: Not separable
Dimension 3: Not separable
Dimension 4: Not separable
Dimension 5: Not separable
Dimension 6: Not separable
Dimension 7: Not separable
Dimension 8: Not separable
```

While our simple test didn't achieve separability in low dimensions, the theoretical result holds: given enough dimensions, any finite dataset becomes separable. This is the fundamental principle behind kernel methods - they implicitly map data to high-dimensional spaces where linear separation becomes possible.

### Simple Kernel Comparison Overview

![Kernel Comparison Overview](../Images/L5_3_Quiz_21/kernel_comparison_overview.png)

This simple, informative visualization provides a comprehensive overview of kernel behavior:

1. **Original Data**: Shows the raw 2D dataset with binary classification
2. **Linear Kernel**: Demonstrates linear decision boundary in the original space
3. **Polynomial Kernel**: Shows how polynomial features transform the data (projected to 2D)

5. **Kernel Matrix**: Heatmap showing pairwise kernel values between data points
6. **Dimensionality Comparison**: Bar chart comparing feature space dimensions for different kernels

### Feature Space Transformation

The polynomial kernel transforms the 2D input space into a 6D feature space, creating new dimensions that capture quadratic relationships between the original features. This transformation makes non-linearly separable data linearly separable in the higher-dimensional space.

### RBF Kernel Behavior

The RBF kernel creates a "similarity" measure that decays exponentially with distance. Points close to each other have high kernel values, while distant points have low values. This creates a local structure that can capture complex decision boundaries.

### Angle Preservation

The angle preservation comparison clearly shows that linear kernels maintain geometric relationships while RBF kernels distort them. This has important implications for algorithms that rely on geometric properties.
