## Understanding the Problem
This question examines the computational aspects of Support Vector Machines, focusing on memory requirements, time complexity, and the relationship between training and prediction costs. Understanding these complexities is crucial for designing efficient SVM implementations and choosing appropriate algorithms for different dataset sizes.

## Solution

### Step 1: Kernel Matrix Size
For $n$ training samples, the **kernel matrix $\mathbf{K}$ has size $n \times n$**.

**Mathematical definition:**
Given training dataset $\mathcal{D} = \{(\mathbf{x}_1, y_1), (\mathbf{x}_2, y_2), \ldots, (\mathbf{x}_n, y_n)\}$, the kernel matrix is:

$$\mathbf{K} = \begin{bmatrix}
K(\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_1) & K(\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2) & \cdots & K(\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_n) \\
K(\mathbf{x}_2, \mathbf{x}_1) & K(\mathbf{x}_2, \mathbf{x}_2) & \cdots & K(\mathbf{x}_2, \mathbf{x}_n) \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
K(\mathbf{x}_n, \mathbf{x}_1) & K(\mathbf{x}_n, \mathbf{x}_2) & \cdots & K(\mathbf{x}_n, \mathbf{x}_n)
\end{bmatrix}$$

Where each element is: $K_{ij} = K(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{x}_j)$

**Dimensions:**
- **Rows**: $n$ (one for each sample $\mathbf{x}_i$)
- **Columns**: $n$ (one for each sample $\mathbf{x}_j$)
- **Total elements**: $n^2$

**Examples:**
| $n$ | Matrix Size | Total Elements |
|-----|-------------|----------------|
| $1{,}000$ | $1{,}000 \times 1{,}000$ | $1{,}000{,}000$ |
| $10{,}000$ | $10{,}000 \times 10{,}000$ | $100{,}000{,}000$ |

### Step 2: Space Complexity for Kernel Matrix Storage
The space complexity for storing the full kernel matrix is **$O(n^2)$**.

**Mathematical analysis:**
Let $b$ = bytes per element (typically $b = 8$ for float64 precision)

Total memory required:
$$M = b \times n^2 \text{ bytes}$$

**Unit conversions:**
- $1 \text{ KB} = 2^{10} = 1,024 \text{ bytes}$
- $1 \text{ MB} = 2^{20} = 1,048,576 \text{ bytes}$
- $1 \text{ GB} = 2^{30} = 1,073,741,824 \text{ bytes}$

**Example calculation for $n = 1{,}000$, $b = 8$:**
$$M = 8 \times (1{,}000)^2 = 8 \times 10^6 = 8{,}000{,}000 \text{ bytes}$$
$$M = \frac{8{,}000{,}000}{2^{20}} = \frac{8{,}000{,}000}{1{,}048{,}576} \approx 7.6 \text{ MB}$$

**Memory requirements table:**
| $n$ | Matrix Size | Memory (MB) | Memory (GB) |
|-----|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| $100$ | $100 \times 100$ | $0.1$ | $0.00$ |
| $1{,}000$ | $1{,}000 \times 1{,}000$ | $7.6$ | $0.01$ |
| $5{,}000$ | $5{,}000 \times 5{,}000$ | $190.7$ | $0.19$ |
| $10{,}000$ | $10{,}000 \times 10{,}000$ | $762.9$ | $0.75$ |
| $50{,}000$ | $50{,}000 \times 50{,}000$ | $19{,}073.5$ | $18.63$ |
| $100{,}000$ | $100{,}000 \times 100{,}000$ | $76{,}293.9$ | $74.51$ |

### Step 3: Maximum Number of Support Vectors
An SVM can have **at most $n$ support vectors** (all training samples).

**When this occurs:**
- Data is not linearly separable
- Regularization parameter $C$ is very large
- All samples lie on or within the margin boundaries
- The problem is highly complex or noisy

**In practice:**
- Good SVMs typically have much fewer support vectors
- Well-separated data: ~5-10% of samples become support vectors
- Overlapping data: ~20-30% of samples become support vectors
- Non-separable data: ~50-80% of samples become support vectors

### Step 4: Prediction Time Complexity
For $100$ support vectors, the prediction time complexity for one new sample is **$O(n_{sv}) = O(100)$**.

**Mathematical derivation:**
The SVM decision function is:
$$f(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{i \in SV} \alpha_i y_i K(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}_i) + b$$

where $SV$ is the set of support vector indices.

**Step-by-step computation for new sample $\mathbf{x}_{new}$:**

For each support vector $\mathbf{x}_i$ where $i \in SV$:
1. **Kernel evaluation**: Compute $K(\mathbf{x}_{new}, \mathbf{x}_i)$ $\rightarrow$ $1$ operation
2. **Multiplication**: Compute $\alpha_i y_i K(\mathbf{x}_{new}, \mathbf{x}_i)$ $\rightarrow$ $1$ operation
3. **Addition**: Add to running sum $\rightarrow$ $1$ operation

**Operation count for $n_{sv} = 100$:**
- **Kernel evaluations**: $100$
- **Multiplications**: $100$
- **Additions**: $99$ (for sum) $+ 1$ (bias) $= 100$
- **Total operations**: $100 + 100 + 100 = 300 = O(n_{sv})$

**General complexity**: $O(n_{sv})$ where $n_{sv} \leq n$

### Step 5: Training vs Prediction Cost Comparison
**Training is significantly more expensive than prediction.**

**Training complexity:**
- SMO algorithm: $O(n^2)$ to $O(n^3)$ depending on convergence
- Standard QP solvers: $O(n^3)$
- Involves solving a complex optimization problem
- Requires multiple iterations through the dataset

**Prediction complexity:**
- $O(n_{sv})$ where $n_{sv} \leq n$
- Simple evaluation of the decision function
- No optimization required
- Typically $n_{sv} \ll n$ for good models

**Why training is more expensive:**
1. **Optimization complexity**: Training solves a quadratic programming problem
2. **Iterative process**: Multiple passes through data until convergence
3. **Kernel computations**: May need to compute many kernel values during training
4. **Memory access**: Training requires access to multiple data points simultaneously
