# Question 9: KKT Conditions Analysis

## Problem Statement
Given the constraint optimization problem for SVM, analyze the KKT conditions:
$$L(\mathbf{w}, b, \boldsymbol{\alpha}) = \frac{1}{2}||\mathbf{w}||^2 - \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i [y_i(\mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{x}_i + b) - 1]$$

### Task
1. Write out all the KKT conditions for optimality
2. Show that $\mathbf{w}^* = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i^* y_i \mathbf{x}_i$
3. Prove that $\alpha_i^* > 0$ only for support vectors
4. For non-support vectors, show that $\alpha_i^* = 0$
5. Derive the condition for computing the bias term $b^*$

## Understanding the Problem
The Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions are necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality in constrained optimization problems. For SVMs, these conditions provide crucial insights into:

- **Support Vector Identification**: Which training points determine the decision boundary
- **Optimal Solution Structure**: How the weight vector relates to training data
- **Sparsity**: Why most Lagrange multipliers are zero
- **Bias Computation**: How to calculate the optimal bias term

The SVM optimization problem is a convex quadratic program with inequality constraints, making the KKT conditions both necessary and sufficient for optimality.

## Solution

We'll systematically analyze each KKT condition and derive the key properties of the SVM solution.

### Step 1: Complete KKT Conditions for SVM

For the SVM optimization problem with Lagrangian:
$$L(\mathbf{w}, b, \boldsymbol{\alpha}) = \frac{1}{2}||\mathbf{w}||^2 - \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i [y_i(\mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{x}_i + b) - 1]$$

The **four KKT conditions** are:

**1. Stationarity Conditions:**
$$\nabla_{\mathbf{w}} L = \mathbf{0} \Rightarrow \mathbf{w} - \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i y_i \mathbf{x}_i = \mathbf{0}$$
$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial b} = 0 \Rightarrow \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i y_i = 0$$

**2. Primal Feasibility:**
$$y_i(\mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{x}_i + b) \geq 1 \quad \text{for all } i = 1, 2, \ldots, n$$

**3. Dual Feasibility:**
$$\alpha_i \geq 0 \quad \text{for all } i = 1, 2, \ldots, n$$

**4. Complementary Slackness:**
$$\alpha_i [y_i(\mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{x}_i + b) - 1] = 0 \quad \text{for all } i = 1, 2, \ldots, n$$

### Step 2: Derivation of Optimal Weight Vector

From the **stationarity condition** $\nabla_{\mathbf{w}} L = \mathbf{0}$:

$$\nabla_{\mathbf{w}} L = \nabla_{\mathbf{w}} \left[\frac{1}{2}||\mathbf{w}||^2 - \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i [y_i(\mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{x}_i + b) - 1]\right]$$

$$= \mathbf{w} - \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i y_i \mathbf{x}_i = \mathbf{0}$$

Therefore:
$$\boxed{\mathbf{w}^* = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i^* y_i \mathbf{x}_i}$$

**Key Insight:** The optimal weight vector is a **linear combination** of the training points, weighted by $\alpha_i^* y_i$. This is the foundation of the "kernel trick" and shows that the solution depends only on inner products between data points.

### Step 3: Support Vector Identification

From **complementary slackness**: $\alpha_i [y_i(\mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{x}_i + b) - 1] = 0$

This condition means that for each training point $i$, **exactly one** of the following must be true:

1. $\alpha_i = 0$ (the constraint is inactive)
2. $y_i(\mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{x}_i + b) - 1 = 0$ (the constraint is active)

**For Support Vectors:**
- $\alpha_i^* > 0$ (Lagrange multiplier is positive)
- $y_i(\mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{x}_i + b) = 1$ (point lies exactly on the margin boundary)
- These points **determine** the decision boundary

**For Non-Support Vectors:**
- $\alpha_i^* = 0$ (Lagrange multiplier is zero)
- $y_i(\mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{x}_i + b) > 1$ (point lies beyond the margin boundary)
- These points **do not affect** the decision boundary

### Step 4: Proof of Sparsity

**Theorem:** $\alpha_i^* = 0$ for all non-support vectors.

**Proof:**
1. From complementary slackness: $\alpha_i [y_i(\mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{x}_i + b) - 1] = 0$
2. For non-support vectors: $y_i(\mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{x}_i + b) > 1$
3. This implies: $y_i(\mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{x}_i + b) - 1 > 0$
4. For the product to equal zero: $\alpha_i = 0$

Therefore, only support vectors (points on the margin boundary) have non-zero Lagrange multipliers.

### Step 5: Bias Term Computation

For any support vector $\mathbf{x}_s$ (where $\alpha_s > 0$):

From complementary slackness: $y_s(\mathbf{w}^{*T}\mathbf{x}_s + b^*) = 1$

Solving for $b^*$:
$$b^* = y_s - \mathbf{w}^{*T}\mathbf{x}_s$$

Substituting $\mathbf{w}^* = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i^* y_i \mathbf{x}_i$:
$$b^* = y_s - \left(\sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i^* y_i \mathbf{x}_i\right)^T \mathbf{x}_s$$
$$b^* = y_s - \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i^* y_i (\mathbf{x}_i^T \mathbf{x}_s)$$

**For numerical stability**, average over all support vectors:
$$\boxed{b^* = \frac{1}{|S|} \sum_{s \in S} \left[y_s - \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i^* y_i (\mathbf{x}_i^T \mathbf{x}_s)\right]}$$

where $S$ is the set of support vector indices.
