# Lecture 9.8: Feature Extraction and Dimensionality Reduction Quiz

## Overview
This quiz contains 5 questions covering different topics from section 9.8 of the lectures on Feature Extraction and Dimensionality Reduction, including feature extraction, PCA, LDA, feature construction, and extraction vs selection.

## Question 1

### Problem Statement
Feature extraction creates new features from existing ones.

#### Task
1. [🔍] What is the difference between feature selection and feature extraction?
2. [🔍] Give an example of feature extraction for numerical data
3. [🔍] Give an example of feature extraction for categorical data
4. [🔍] When would you choose feature extraction over feature selection?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 1: Feature Extraction Concepts](L9_8_1_explanation.md).

## Question 2

### Problem Statement
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a linear dimensionality reduction technique.

#### Task
1. [📚] What does PCA do to the original features?
2. [📚] How do you choose the number of principal components?
3. [📚] What does the explained variance ratio tell you?
4. [📚] What are the assumptions of PCA?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 2: PCA Fundamentals](L9_8_2_explanation.md).

## Question 3

### Problem Statement
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a supervised dimensionality reduction method.

#### Task
1. [📚] How does LDA differ from PCA?
2. [📚] What is the objective function that LDA optimizes?
3. [📚] How many components can LDA extract for a $k$-class problem?
4. [📚] When would you use LDA instead of PCA?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 3: LDA vs PCA Comparison](L9_8_3_explanation.md).

## Question 4

### Problem Statement
Feature construction involves creating mathematical combinations of features.

#### Task
1. [📚] What are polynomial features and when are they useful?
2. [📚] How do you create interaction features?
3. [📚] What is the risk of creating too many constructed features?
4. [📚] How do you validate that constructed features improve performance?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 4: Feature Construction Methods](L9_8_4_explanation.md).

## Question 5

### Problem Statement
Consider different scenarios for choosing between feature extraction and selection.

#### Task
1. [📚] **Scenario A**: High-dimensional data with many correlated features
2. [📚] **Scenario B**: Small dataset with interpretability requirements
3. [📚] **Scenario C**: Text data with thousands of word features
4. [📚] **Scenario D**: Time series data with temporal patterns

For each scenario, recommend whether to use feature extraction, selection, or both, and explain your reasoning.

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 5: Extraction vs Selection Strategy](L9_8_5_explanation.md).
