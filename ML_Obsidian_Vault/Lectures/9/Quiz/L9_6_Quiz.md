# Lecture 9.6: Wrapper Methods Quiz

## Overview
This quiz contains 5 questions covering different topics from section 9.6 of the lectures on Wrapper Methods, including learning algorithm-based selection, forward selection, backward elimination, recursive feature elimination, and wrapper method advantages/limitations.

## Question 1

### Problem Statement
Wrapper methods use the learning algorithm to evaluate feature subsets.

#### Task
1. [🔍] What is the key difference between filter and wrapper methods?
2. [🔍] How do wrapper methods evaluate feature subsets?
3. [🔍] What is the computational cost of wrapper methods?
4. [🔍] Why are wrapper methods considered more accurate than filter methods?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 1: Wrapper Methods Overview](L9_6_1_explanation.md).

## Question 2

### Problem Statement
Forward selection starts with no features and adds them one by one.

#### Task
1. [📚] How does forward selection work step by step?
2. [📚] What is the stopping criterion for forward selection?
3. [📚] What are the advantages of forward selection?
4. [📚] What are the limitations of forward selection?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 2: Forward Selection Algorithm](L9_6_2_explanation.md).

## Question 3

### Problem Statement
Backward elimination starts with all features and removes them one by one.

#### Task
1. [📚] How does backward elimination work step by step?
2. [📚] What is the stopping criterion for backward elimination?
3. [📚] When would you choose backward over forward selection?
4. [📚] What are the computational considerations for backward elimination?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 3: Backward Elimination Algorithm](L9_6_3_explanation.md).

## Question 4

### Problem Statement
Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) uses model coefficients to rank features.

#### Task
1. [📚] How does RFE work with linear models?
2. [📚] How does RFE work with tree-based models?
3. [📚] What is the advantage of RFE over forward/backward selection?
4. [📚] How do you choose the number of features to keep in RFE?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 4: Recursive Feature Elimination](L9_6_4_explanation.md).

## Question 5

### Problem Statement
Wrapper methods have both advantages and limitations compared to filter methods.

#### Task
1. [📚] **Advantage 1**: How do wrapper methods handle feature interactions?
2. [📚] **Advantage 2**: Why do wrapper methods often achieve better performance?
3. [📚] **Limitation 1**: What is the computational cost tradeoff?
4. [📚] **Limitation 2**: How do wrapper methods handle overfitting?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 5: Wrapper Method Tradeoffs](L9_6_5_explanation.md).
