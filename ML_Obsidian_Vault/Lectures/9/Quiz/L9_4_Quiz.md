# Lecture 9.4: Correlation Criteria and Analysis Quiz

## Overview
This quiz contains 5 questions covering different topics from section 9.4 of the lectures on Correlation Criteria and Analysis, including Pearson correlation, Spearman correlation, correlation thresholds, and multicollinearity.

## Question 1

### Problem Statement
Consider the following dataset with two features and a target:

| Sample | Feature X | Feature Y | Target |
|--------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| 1      | 1         | 2         | 5      |
| 2      | 2         | 4         | 10     |
| 3      | 3         | 6         | 15     |
| 4      | 4         | 8         | 20     |
| 5      | 5         | 10        | 25     |

#### Task
1. [🔍] Calculate the Pearson correlation between Feature X and Target
2. [🔍] Calculate the Pearson correlation between Feature Y and Target
3. [🔍] What is the relationship between Feature X and Feature Y?
4. [🔍] Which feature would be more useful for predicting the target?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 1: Pearson Correlation Calculation](L9_4_1_explanation.md).

## Question 2

### Problem Statement
Pearson correlation measures linear relationships between variables.

#### Task
1. [📚] What is the mathematical formula for Pearson correlation?
2. [📚] What range of values can Pearson correlation take?
3. [📚] What does a correlation of 0, 1, and -1 mean?
4. [📚] What are the assumptions of Pearson correlation?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 2: Pearson Correlation Properties](L9_4_2_explanation.md).

## Question 3

### Problem Statement
Spearman correlation measures monotonic relationships between variables.

#### Task
1. [📚] What is the difference between Pearson and Spearman correlation?
2. [📚] When would you use Spearman instead of Pearson?
3. [📚] How is Spearman correlation calculated?
4. [📚] What types of relationships does Spearman capture?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 3: Spearman Correlation Analysis](L9_4_3_explanation.md).

## Question 4

### Problem Statement
Correlation thresholds help determine which features to keep or remove.

#### Task
1. [📚] How do you choose a correlation threshold for feature selection?
2. [📚] What are common threshold values used in practice?
3. [📚] What happens if you set the threshold too high or too low?
4. [📚] How do you handle the case where a feature is highly correlated with the target?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 4: Correlation Thresholds](L9_4_4_explanation.md).

## Question 5

### Problem Statement
Multicollinearity occurs when features are highly correlated with each other.

#### Task
1. [📚] What is multicollinearity and why is it problematic?
2. [📚] How can you detect multicollinearity in your data?
3. [📚] What are the effects of multicollinearity on model performance?
4. [📚] How do you handle multicollinearity in feature selection?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 5: Multicollinearity Handling](L9_4_5_explanation.md).
