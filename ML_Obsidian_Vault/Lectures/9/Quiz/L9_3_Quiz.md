# Lecture 9.3: Multivariate Feature Selection Quiz

## Overview
This quiz contains 5 questions covering different topics from section 9.3 of the lectures on Multivariate Feature Selection, including feature subset evaluation, redundancy detection, feature interaction, and multivariate methods.

## Question 1

### Problem Statement
Consider the following feature correlation matrix:

| Feature | F1   | F2   | F3   | F4   |
|---------|------|------|------|------|
| F1      | 1.0  | 0.8  | 0.1  | 0.2  |
| F2      | 0.8  | 1.0  | 0.2  | 0.1  |
| F3      | 0.1  | 0.2  | 1.0  | 0.9  |
| F4      | 0.2  | 0.1  | 0.9  | 1.0  |

#### Task
1. [🔍] Identify which feature pairs show high correlation
2. [🔍] If you had to remove one feature from each highly correlated pair, which would you keep?
3. [🔍] What is the potential problem with keeping both F1 and F2?
4. [🔍] How would you handle the correlation between F3 and F4?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 1: Feature Correlation Analysis](L9_3_1_explanation.md).

## Question 2

### Problem Statement
Feature subset evaluation considers the performance of feature combinations.

#### Task
1. [📚] What is the difference between univariate and multivariate feature selection?
2. [📚] How do you evaluate a feature subset?
3. [📚] What is the computational challenge of exhaustive feature subset search?
4. [📚] How does multivariate selection capture feature interactions?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 2: Feature Subset Evaluation](L9_3_2_explanation.md).

## Question 3

### Problem Statement
Redundancy detection identifies features that provide similar information.

#### Task
1. [📚] What is feature redundancy and why is it problematic?
2. [📚] How can you detect redundant features?
3. [📚] What is the difference between redundancy and correlation?
4. [📚] How do you decide which redundant feature to remove?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 3: Redundancy Detection Methods](L9_3_3_explanation.md).

## Question 4

### Problem Statement
Feature interactions occur when features work together to predict the target.

#### Task
1. [📚] What is a feature interaction?
2. [📚] How can you create interaction features?
3. [📚] What are the challenges of including all possible interactions?
4. [📚] How do you evaluate the importance of interaction features?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 4: Feature Interaction Detection](L9_3_4_explanation.md).

## Question 5

### Problem Statement
Multivariate methods include recursive feature elimination and genetic algorithms.

#### Task
1. [📚] How does Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) work?
2. [📚] What are the advantages of genetic algorithms for feature selection?
3. [📚] How do you handle the computational cost of multivariate methods?
4. [📚] When would you choose multivariate over univariate selection?
