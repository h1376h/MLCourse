# Lecture 9.7: Search Strategies and Methods Quiz

## Overview
This quiz contains 5 questions covering different topics from section 9.7 of the lectures on Search Strategies and Methods, including exhaustive search, greedy algorithms, genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, and search method comparison.

## Question 1

### Problem Statement
Exhaustive search evaluates all possible feature subsets.

#### Task
1. [🔍] How many feature subsets exist for a dataset with $n$ features?
2. [🔍] What is the computational complexity of exhaustive search?
3. [🔍] When would exhaustive search be feasible?
