# Lecture 11.7: Hybrid and Ensemble Methods Quiz

## Overview
This quiz contains 5 questions covering different topics from section 11.7 of the lectures on Hybrid and Ensemble Methods, including hybrid methods, SMOTEENN, SMOTETomek, ensemble methods, and balanced ensembles.

## Question 1

### Problem Statement
Hybrid methods combine oversampling and undersampling techniques.

#### Task
1. [🔍] What is the advantage of combining oversampling and undersampling?
2. [🔍] How do hybrid methods address the limitations of individual approaches?
3. [🔍] What is the typical order of operations in hybrid methods?
4. [🔍] When would you choose hybrid methods over single approaches?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 1: Hybrid Methods Overview](L11_7_1_explanation.md).

## Question 2

### Problem Statement
SMOTEENN combines SMOTE with Edited Nearest Neighbors.

#### Task
1. [📚] What is the first step in SMOTEENN?
2. [📚] What is the second step in SMOTEENN?
3. [📚] How does ENN help clean the data after SMOTE?
4. [📚] What are the advantages of SMOTEENN over SMOTE alone?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 2: SMOTEENN Algorithm](L11_7_2_explanation.md).

## Question 3

### Problem Statement
SMOTETomek combines SMOTE with Tomek links.

#### Task
1. [📚] What are Tomek links and how are they identified?
2. [📚] How does SMOTETomek work step by step?
3. [📚] What is the purpose of removing Tomek links?
4. [📚] When is SMOTETomek more appropriate than SMOTEENN?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 3: SMOTETomek Algorithm](L11_7_3_explanation.md).

## Question 4

### Problem Statement
Ensemble methods can be adapted for imbalanced data.

#### Task

2. [📚] What is the advantage of using multiple balanced datasets?
3. [📚] How do you combine predictions from balanced ensembles?
4. [📚] What are the computational considerations for balanced ensembles?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 4: Balanced Ensemble Methods](L11_7_4_explanation.md).

## Question 5

### Problem Statement
Different hybrid and ensemble approaches have different characteristics.

#### Task
1. [📚] **Method A**: SMOTEENN - when to use and why?
2. [📚] **Method B**: SMOTETomek - when to use and why?
3. [📚] **Method C**: Balanced Random Forest - when to use and why?
4. [📚] **Method D**: Balanced Bagging - when to use and why?

For each method, explain the scenarios where it's most appropriate and the tradeoffs involved.
