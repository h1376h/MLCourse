# Lecture 11.6: Advanced Synthetic Data Methods Quiz

## Overview
This quiz contains 5 questions covering different topics from section 11.6 of the lectures on Advanced Synthetic Data Methods, including advanced synthetic methods, ADASYN, Borderline SMOTE, Safe Level SMOTE, and data augmentation.

## Question 1

### Problem Statement
ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling) adaptively generates synthetic samples.

#### Task
1. [🔍] How does ADASYN differ from basic SMOTE?
2. [🔍] What is the "adaptive" aspect of ADASYN?
3. [🔍] How does ADASYN determine where to generate synthetic samples?
4. [🔍] What problem does ADASYN solve that basic SMOTE doesn't?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 1: ADASYN Algorithm](L11_6_1_explanation.md).

## Question 2

### Problem Statement
Borderline SMOTE focuses on samples near the decision boundary.

#### Task
1. [📚] What is the "borderline" in Borderline SMOTE?
2. [📚] How do you identify borderline samples?
3. [📚] Why are borderline samples important for classification?
4. [📚] How does Borderline SMOTE improve over basic SMOTE?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 2: Borderline SMOTE](L11_6_2_explanation.md).

## Question 3

### Problem Statement
Safe Level SMOTE ensures synthetic samples are generated in safe regions.

#### Task
1. [📚] What is the "safe level" concept in Safe Level SMOTE?
2. [📚] How do you calculate the safe level for a minority sample?
3. [📚] What are the different categories of minority samples?
4. [📚] How does Safe Level SMOTE prevent noise generation?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 3: Safe Level SMOTE](L11_6_3_explanation.md).

## Question 4

### Problem Statement
Data augmentation creates variations of existing samples.

#### Task
1. [📚] What is the difference between data augmentation and SMOTE?
2. [📚] How do you apply data augmentation to numerical features?
3. [📚] How do you apply data augmentation to categorical features?
4. [📚] What are the limitations of data augmentation?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 4: Data Augmentation Methods](L11_6_4_explanation.md).

## Question 5

### Problem Statement
Different advanced synthetic methods serve different purposes.

#### Task
1. [📚] **Method A**: ADASYN - when to use and why?
2. [📚] **Method B**: Borderline SMOTE - when to use and why?
3. [📚] **Method C**: Safe Level SMOTE - when to use and why?
4. [📚] **Method D**: Data Augmentation - when to use and why?

For each method, explain the scenarios where it's most appropriate.

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 5: Advanced Method Selection](L11_6_5_explanation.md).
