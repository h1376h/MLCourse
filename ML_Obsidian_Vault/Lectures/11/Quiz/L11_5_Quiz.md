# Lecture 11.5: SMOTE and Synthetic Data Generation Quiz

## Overview
This quiz contains 5 questions covering different topics from section 11.5 of the lectures on SMOTE and Synthetic Data Generation, including SMOTE concept, algorithm, implementation, variants, and advantages/limitations.

## Question 1

### Problem Statement
SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) creates synthetic samples.

#### Task
1. [🔍] What is the main idea behind SMOTE?
2. [🔍] How does SMOTE differ from random oversampling?
3. [🔍] What is the mathematical principle of SMOTE?
4. [🔍] Why is SMOTE considered more sophisticated than duplication?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 1: SMOTE Concept and Principles](L11_5_1_explanation.md).

## Question 2

### Problem Statement
The SMOTE algorithm follows specific steps to generate synthetic samples.

#### Task
1. [📚] What is the first step in the SMOTE algorithm?
2. [📚] How do you find the k-nearest neighbors for a minority sample?
3. [📚] How do you generate a synthetic sample from two existing samples?
4. [📚] What is the role of the random factor in SMOTE?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 2: SMOTE Algorithm Steps](L11_5_2_explanation.md).

## Question 3

### Problem Statement
SMOTE implementation requires careful consideration of parameters.

#### Task
1. [📚] How do you choose the number of neighbors (k) in SMOTE?
2. [📚] How do you determine how many synthetic samples to create?
3. [📚] What preprocessing steps are necessary before applying SMOTE?
4. [📚] How do you handle categorical features in SMOTE?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 3: SMOTE Implementation](L11_5_3_explanation.md).

## Question 4

### Problem Statement
SMOTE has several variants that address different challenges.

#### Task
1. [📚] What is Borderline SMOTE and when is it used?
2. [📚] What is ADASYN and how does it differ from SMOTE?
3. [📚] What is Safe Level SMOTE and what problem does it solve?
4. [📚] How do you choose between different SMOTE variants?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 4: SMOTE Variants](L11_5_4_explanation.md).

## Question 5

### Problem Statement
SMOTE has both advantages and limitations compared to other methods.

#### Task
1. [📚] **Advantage 1**: How does SMOTE avoid overfitting?
2. [📚] **Advantage 2**: Why does SMOTE create more diverse data?
3. [📚] **Limitation 1**: When does SMOTE fail to work properly?
4. [📚] **Limitation 2**: What are the computational challenges of SMOTE?
