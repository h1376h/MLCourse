# Lecture 11.4: Random Undersampling Quiz

## Overview
This quiz contains 5 questions covering different topics from section 11.4 of the lectures on Random Undersampling, including undersampling process, advantages, limitations, strategies, and examples.

## Question 1

### Problem Statement
Consider a dataset with 1000 samples: 900 majority class (0) and 100 minority class (1).

#### Task
1. [🔍] How many majority class samples would you remove to achieve balanced classes?
2. [🔍] What would be the final dataset size after undersampling?
3. [🔍] What percentage of majority class data would be lost?
4. [🔍] What is the undersampling ratio in this case?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 1: Undersampling Calculations](L11_4_1_explanation.md).

## Question 2

### Problem Statement
Random undersampling reduces majority class samples randomly.

#### Task
1. [📚] How does random undersampling work step by step?
2. [📚] What is the difference between undersampling and oversampling?
3. [📚] How do you implement random undersampling in practice?
4. [📚] What are the computational considerations?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 2: Undersampling Process](L11_4_2_explanation.md).

## Question 3

### Problem Statement
Random undersampling has several advantages over other methods.

#### Task
1. [📚] **Advantage 1**: How does undersampling reduce computational cost?
2. [📚] **Advantage 2**: Why does undersampling avoid overfitting?
3. [📚] **Advantage 3**: How does undersampling improve model interpretability?
4. [📚] **Advantage 4**: When is undersampling more appropriate than oversampling?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 3: Undersampling Advantages](L11_4_3_explanation.md).

## Question 4

### Problem Statement
Random undersampling also has limitations that should be considered.

#### Task
1. [📚] **Limitation 1**: How does undersampling lead to information loss?
2. [📚] **Limitation 2**: Why might undersampling not improve minority class performance?
3. [📚] **Limitation 3**: How does undersampling affect model robustness?
4. [📚] **Limitation 4**: What happens when majority class has important patterns?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 4: Undersampling Limitations](L11_4_4_explanation.md).

## Question 5

### Problem Statement
Different undersampling strategies can be more effective than random selection.

#### Task
1. [📚] What is Tomek links and how do they help?
2. [📚] What is Edited Nearest Neighbors (ENN)?
3. [📚] How do you choose which majority samples to remove?
4. [📚] When should you use informed vs random undersampling?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 5: Undersampling Strategies](L11_4_5_explanation.md).
