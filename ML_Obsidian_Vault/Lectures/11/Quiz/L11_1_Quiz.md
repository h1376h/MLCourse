# Lecture 11.1: Understanding Class Imbalance Quiz

## Overview
This quiz contains 5 questions covering different topics from section 11.1 of the lectures on Understanding Class Imbalance, including class imbalance concepts, problems, imbalance ratios, real-world examples, and imbalance detection.

## Question 1

### Problem Statement
Consider the following dataset with class distribution:

| Class | Count | Percentage |
|-------|-------|------------|
| 0     | 950   | 95%        |
| 1     | 50    | 5%         |

#### Task
1. [🔍] What is the imbalance ratio in this dataset?
2. [🔍] Would you classify this as mild, moderate, or severe imbalance?
3. [🔍] What problems might arise when training a classifier on this data?
4. [🔍] How would you measure the severity of imbalance?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 1: Class Imbalance Analysis](L11_1_1_explanation.md).

## Question 2

### Problem Statement
Class imbalance causes several problems in machine learning.

#### Task
1. [📚] How does class imbalance affect model training?
2. [📚] Why do models tend to predict the majority class?
3. [📚] What happens to minority class performance?
4. [📚] How does imbalance affect evaluation metrics?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 2: Problems with Imbalanced Data](L11_1_2_explanation.md).

## Question 3

### Problem Statement
Different imbalance ratios require different handling strategies.

#### Task
1. [📚] What characterizes mild imbalance (e.g., 60:40)?
2. [📚] What characterizes moderate imbalance (e.g., 80:20)?
3. [📚] What characterizes severe imbalance (e.g., 95:5)?
4. [📚] How do you choose strategies based on imbalance level?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 3: Imbalance Ratio Classification](L11_1_3_explanation.md).

## Question 4

### Problem Statement
Real-world applications often have imbalanced data.

#### Task
1. [📚] **Example A**: Fraud detection in credit card transactions
2. [📚] **Example B**: Medical diagnosis of rare diseases
3. [📚] **Example C**: Customer churn prediction
4. [📚] **Example D**: Anomaly detection in manufacturing

For each example, identify the imbalance characteristics and why they occur.

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 4: Real-World Imbalance Examples](L11_1_4_explanation.md).

## Question 5

### Problem Statement
Detecting class imbalance is the first step in addressing it.

#### Task
1. [📚] What visualizations help identify class imbalance?
2. [📚] What statistical measures indicate imbalance?
3. [📚] How do you quantify the severity of imbalance?
4. [📚] What thresholds do you use to classify imbalance levels?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 5: Imbalance Detection Methods](L11_1_5_explanation.md).
