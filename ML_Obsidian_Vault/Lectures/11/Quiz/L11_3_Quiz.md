# Lecture 11.3: Random Oversampling Quiz

## Overview
This quiz contains 5 questions covering different topics from section 11.3 of the lectures on Random Oversampling, including oversampling process, advantages, limitations, implementation considerations, and examples.

## Question 1

### Problem Statement
Consider a dataset with 1000 samples: 900 majority class (0) and 100 minority class (1).

#### Task
1. [🔍] How many samples would you add to achieve balanced classes?
2. [🔍] What would be the final class distribution after oversampling?
3. [🔍] How many duplicate samples would be created?
4. [🔍] What is the oversampling ratio in this case?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 1: Oversampling Calculations](L11_3_1_explanation.md).

## Question 2

### Problem Statement
Random oversampling duplicates existing minority class samples.

#### Task
1. [📚] How does random oversampling work step by step?
2. [📚] What is the difference between random oversampling and data augmentation?
3. [📚] How do you implement random oversampling in practice?
4. [📚] What are the computational considerations?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 2: Oversampling Process](L11_3_2_explanation.md).

## Question 3

### Problem Statement
Random oversampling has several advantages over other methods.

#### Task
1. [📚] **Advantage 1**: How does oversampling handle class imbalance?
2. [📚] **Advantage 2**: Why is oversampling simple to implement?
3. [📚] **Advantage 3**: How does oversampling preserve original data distribution?
4. [📚] **Advantage 4**: When is oversampling computationally efficient?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 3: Oversampling Advantages](L11_3_3_explanation.md).

## Question 4

### Problem Statement
Random oversampling also has limitations that should be considered.

#### Task
1. [📚] **Limitation 1**: How does oversampling lead to overfitting?
2. [📚] **Limitation 2**: Why might oversampling not improve generalization?
3. [📚] **Limitation 3**: How does oversampling affect model interpretability?
4. [📚] **Limitation 4**: What happens when minority class has limited samples?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 4: Oversampling Limitations](L11_4_4_explanation.md).

## Question 5

### Problem Statement
Implementation considerations are important for effective oversampling.

#### Task
1. [📚] How do you choose the target class distribution?
2. [📚] What validation strategy should you use with oversampling?
3. [📚] How do you handle multiple minority classes?
4. [📚] When should you combine oversampling with other techniques?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 5: Oversampling Implementation](L11_3_5_explanation.md).
