# Lecture 8.1: Foundations of Unsupervised Learning Quiz

## Overview
This quiz contains 5 questions covering different topics from section 8.1 of the lectures on Foundations of Unsupervised Learning, including unsupervised learning concepts, clustering overview, distance metrics, and applications.

## Question 1

### Problem Statement
Explain the fundamental differences between supervised and unsupervised learning in machine learning.

#### Task
1. [🔍] Define supervised and unsupervised learning in one sentence each
2. [🔍] List two key differences between supervised and unsupervised learning in terms of data requirements
3. [🔍] Give an example of when you would use unsupervised learning instead of supervised learning
4. Explain how the learning objectives differ between these two approaches

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 1: Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning](L8_1_1_explanation.md).

## Question 2

### Problem Statement
Consider the following dataset with 6 data points in 2D space:

| Point | $x_1$ | $x_2$ |
|-------|-------|-------|
| A     | 1     | 2     |
| B     | 2     | 3     |
| C     | 8     | 9     |
| D     | 9     | 8     |
| E     | 1     | 3     |
| F     | 8     | 7     |

#### Task
1. [📚] Calculate the Euclidean distance between points A and B
2. [📚] Calculate the Manhattan distance between points C and D
3. [📚] Identify which pairs of points are most similar based on Euclidean distance
4. [📚] Suggest how you would group these points into clusters

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 2: Distance Metrics and Similarity](L8_1_2_explanation.md).

## Question 3

### Problem Statement
Consider a clustering problem where you want to group customers based on their purchasing behavior.

#### Task
1. [📚] What type of data would you collect for customer clustering?
2. [📚] How would you measure similarity between customers?
3. [📚] What challenges might you face when clustering customer data?
4. [📚] How would you evaluate the quality of your customer clusters?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 3: Customer Segmentation Clustering](L8_1_3_explanation.md).

## Question 4

### Problem Statement
You are given a dataset with 1000 samples and 50 features, and you want to perform clustering.

#### Task
1. [📚] What is the "curse of dimensionality" and how does it affect clustering?
2. [📚] How would you determine the optimal number of clusters?
3. [📚] What preprocessing steps might be necessary before clustering?
4. [📚] How would you handle categorical features in your clustering algorithm?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 4: High-Dimensional Clustering Challenges](L8_1_4_explanation.md).

## Question 5

### Problem Statement
Consider the following scenarios and determine whether clustering would be appropriate:

#### Task
1. [📚] **Scenario A**: Predicting house prices based on square footage and location
2. [📚] **Scenario B**: Grouping news articles by topic without predefined categories
3. [📚] **Scenario C**: Classifying emails as spam or not spam
4. [📚] **Scenario D**: Finding natural groups in customer transaction data

For each scenario, explain whether it's a clustering problem and why or why not.

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 5: Identifying Clustering Problems](L8_1_5_explanation.md).
