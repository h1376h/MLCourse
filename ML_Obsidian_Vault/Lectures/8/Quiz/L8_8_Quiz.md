# Lecture 8.8: Clustering Applications and Case Studies Quiz

## Overview
This quiz contains 5 questions covering different topics from section 8.8 of the lectures on Clustering Applications and Case Studies, including image segmentation, customer segmentation, document clustering, and anomaly detection.

## Question 1

### Problem Statement
Image segmentation uses clustering to group similar pixels together.

#### Task
1. [🔍] How would you represent an image pixel as a feature vector for clustering?
2. [🔍] What distance metric would be appropriate for color-based clustering?
3. [🔍] How does the choice of K affect the segmentation quality?
4. [🔍] What are the advantages of using clustering for image segmentation?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 1: Image Segmentation with Clustering](L8_8_1_explanation.md).

## Question 2

### Problem Statement
Customer segmentation groups customers based on purchasing behavior and demographics.

#### Task
1. [📚] What types of features would you use for customer clustering?
2. [📚] How would you handle mixed data types (numerical and categorical)?
3. [📚] What clustering algorithm would be most appropriate for customer data?
4. [📚] How would you validate the quality of customer segments?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 2: Customer Segmentation Strategies](L8_8_2_explanation.md).

## Question 3

### Problem Statement
Document clustering groups similar documents together based on content.

#### Task
1. [📚] How would you represent documents as feature vectors?
2. [📚] What preprocessing steps are necessary for document clustering?
3. [📚] How would you handle documents of different lengths?
4. [📚] What distance metric would be appropriate for document similarity?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 3: Document Clustering Methods](L8_8_3_explanation.md).

## Question 4

### Problem Statement
Anomaly detection can use clustering to identify unusual data points.

#### Task
1. [📚] How can clustering help identify anomalies?
2. [📚] What makes a data point an "anomaly" in clustering?
3. [📚] How would you use DBSCAN for anomaly detection?
4. [📚] What are the limitations of clustering-based anomaly detection?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 4: Anomaly Detection with Clustering](L8_8_4_explanation.md).

## Question 5

### Problem Statement
Consider real-world challenges in applying clustering algorithms.

#### Task
1. [📚] **Challenge 1**: How do you handle missing values in clustering?
2. [📚] **Challenge 2**: How do you scale features appropriately?
3. [📚] **Challenge 3**: How do you interpret clustering results for stakeholders?
4. [📚] **Challenge 4**: How do you update clusters when new data arrives?

For each challenge, suggest practical solutions and considerations.

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 5: Practical Clustering Challenges](L8_8_5_explanation.md).
