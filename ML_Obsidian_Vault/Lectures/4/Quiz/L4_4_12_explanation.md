# Question 12: LDA vs. Logistic Regression

## Problem Statement
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) approaches classification from a generative modeling perspective, unlike the discriminative approach of Logistic Regression.

### Task
1. Given the between-class scatter matrix $S_B = \begin{bmatrix} 4 & 2 \\ 2 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$ and within-class scatter matrix $S_W = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 \end{bmatrix}$, find the direction that maximizes class separation in LDA
2. For binary classification with LDA, if the prior probabilities are equal, where is the decision boundary located relative to the two class means?
3. Compare and contrast how LDA and Logistic Regression would behave with outliers in the training data in one sentence
4. When would you prefer Logistic Regression over LDA? List one specific scenario

## Understanding the Problem
This problem explores the fundamental differences between Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Logistic Regression, two popular approaches to linear classification. LDA is a generative model that models the class-conditional densities and uses Bayes' rule, while Logistic Regression is a discriminative model that directly models the posterior probability. Understanding these differences is crucial for selecting the appropriate algorithm for specific classification tasks.

## Solution

### Step 1: Finding the LDA Direction for Maximum Class Separation

In LDA, the goal is to find a projection direction that maximizes the ratio of between-class scatter to within-class scatter. This is achieved by finding the eigenvectors of $S_W^{-1}S_B$.

First, let's calculate $S_W^{-1}S_B$:

$$S_W^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{2} & 0 \\ 0 & \frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}$$

$$S_W^{-1}S_B = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{2} & 0 \\ 0 & \frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 4 & 2 \\ 2 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 1 & 0.5 \end{bmatrix}$$

Next, we find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix:

```
Eigenvalues:
λ1 = 2.5000
λ2 = 0.0000

Eigenvectors (columns):
[[ 0.89442719 -0.4472136 ]
 [ 0.4472136   0.89442719]]
```

The direction that maximizes class separation is the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue (λ1 = 2.5):

$$w = [0.89442719, 0.4472136]^T$$

The visualization shows:
- The blue ellipse represents the between-class scatter matrix $S_B$
- The red ellipse represents the within-class scatter matrix $S_W$
- The green arrow indicates the LDA projection direction that maximizes class separation

This direction effectively maximizes the separation between classes while minimizing the scatter within each class.

### Step 2: LDA Decision Boundary with Equal Prior Probabilities

For binary classification with LDA, when the prior probabilities are equal, the decision boundary has specific geometric properties.

![LDA Decision Boundary](../Images/L4_4_Quiz_12/lda_decision_boundary.png)

The decision boundary in LDA with equal priors is:
1. Perpendicular to the line connecting the two class means
2. Passes through the midpoint of the line connecting the means

In mathematical terms, for class means $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ with equal prior probabilities, the decision boundary is:

$$(x - \frac{\mu_1 + \mu_2}{2})^T \Sigma^{-1}(\mu_1 - \mu_2) = 0$$

This creates a linear boundary that is orthogonal to the line joining the means and passes through the midpoint.

The visualization shows:
- Blue points represent Class 1 with mean $\mu_1 = [1, 2]^T$
- Red points represent Class 2 with mean $\mu_2 = [4, 0]^T$
- The green line connects the two means
- The purple dot marks the midpoint at $[2.5, 1]^T$
- The dashed black line shows the decision boundary, which is perpendicular to the line connecting the means and passes through the midpoint

### Step 3: LDA vs. Logistic Regression with Outliers

Let's examine how LDA and Logistic Regression behave in the presence of outliers in the training data.

![LDA vs Logistic Regression with Outliers](../Images/L4_4_Quiz_12/lda_vs_logreg_outliers.png)

The visualization reveals:
- LDA (left) shows significant sensitivity to the outliers (green circles), with the decision boundary shifting substantially in response to them
- Logistic Regression (right) demonstrates greater robustness, with the decision boundary less influenced by the outliers

LDA is more sensitive to outliers than Logistic Regression because it models the class-conditional distributions and estimates mean and covariance parameters, which can be heavily skewed by extreme values, whereas Logistic Regression directly models the decision boundary and can downweight the influence of individual outliers.

### Step 4: When to Prefer Logistic Regression over LDA

There are several scenarios where Logistic Regression would be preferred over LDA:

![LDA vs Logistic Regression with Non-Gaussian Data](../Images/L4_4_Quiz_12/lda_vs_logreg_non_gaussian.png)

1. **Non-Gaussian Data Distributions**: LDA assumes that each class follows a Gaussian distribution with the same covariance matrix. When this assumption is violated, Logistic Regression often performs better.

2. **Different Covariance Matrices**: When classes have different covariance structures, LDA's assumption of equal covariances is violated, making Logistic Regression more appropriate.

3. **Presence of Outliers**: As demonstrated in Step 3, Logistic Regression is more robust to outliers.

4. **Direct Probability Estimation**: When accurate probability estimates are more important than the generative model, Logistic Regression provides better calibrated probabilities.

5. **Large Training Sets**: With large amounts of data, the discriminative approach of Logistic Regression often outperforms the generative approach of LDA.

The visualization compares LDA and Logistic Regression on uniformly distributed (non-Gaussian) data. In this specific example, both models achieve perfect accuracy, but in more complex scenarios, Logistic Regression would generally handle non-Gaussian data better.

## Key Insights

### Theoretical Foundations
- LDA is a generative model that estimates class-conditional densities $P(x|y)$ and applies Bayes' rule, while Logistic Regression is a discriminative model that directly estimates $P(y|x)$.
- LDA maximizes the ratio of between-class variance to within-class variance, seeking a projection that clusters same-class samples while separating different classes.
- LDA assumes Gaussian distributions with equal covariance matrices for all classes, which is a strong assumption that may not hold in practice.
- Logistic Regression makes fewer assumptions about the underlying data distributions.

### Geometric Interpretation
- The LDA direction is the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of $S_W^{-1}S_B$.
- With equal priors, the LDA decision boundary is perpendicular to the line connecting class means and passes through their midpoint.
- This is analogous to a maximum-margin separator in the transformed space defined by the class means and covariance structure.

### Practical Considerations
- LDA is typically more data-efficient when its assumptions are met, requiring fewer samples to estimate parameters.
- Logistic Regression is more robust to outliers and non-Gaussian distributions.
- LDA provides insightful generative parameters (means, covariances) that can help understand the data structure.
- Logistic Regression often provides better-calibrated probabilities, making it suitable for applications requiring reliable probability estimates.

### Computational Aspects
- LDA has a closed-form solution, making it computationally efficient.
- Logistic Regression requires iterative optimization (e.g., gradient descent), which can be more computationally intensive.
- LDA can be more numerically stable with small datasets.

## Conclusion
- The direction that maximizes class separation in LDA is the eigenvector of $S_W^{-1}S_B$ with the largest eigenvalue, which in this case is $[0.89442719, 0.4472136]^T$.
- For binary LDA with equal prior probabilities, the decision boundary is perpendicular to the line connecting the two class means and passes through their midpoint.
- LDA is more sensitive to outliers than Logistic Regression because it models the underlying distributions and estimates mean and covariance parameters that can be skewed by extreme values.
- Logistic Regression is preferred over LDA when the data doesn't follow Gaussian distributions, when classes have different covariance structures, when there are outliers in the dataset, when accurate probability calibration is important, or when the training set is large enough to compensate for the potential higher variance of the discriminative approach.
