# Question 5: Classifier Characteristics

## Problem Statement
Consider the margin concept in linear classifiers. The following statements relate to different linear classification methods.

### Task
For each statement, identify whether it applies to: (a) Perceptron, (b) Logistic Regression, (c) Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), or (d) Support Vector Machine (SVM)

1. Finds a decision boundary that maximizes the margin between classes
2. Uses a probabilistic approach based on class-conditional densities and Bayes' rule
3. Simply tries to find any decision boundary that separates the classes
4. Directly models the posterior probability $P(y|x)$ using the sigmoid function
5. Is a discriminative model that maximizes the ratio of between-class to within-class scatter

## Understanding the Problem
This problem requires understanding the key principles and optimization objectives of four common linear classification algorithms: Perceptron, Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Each algorithm has distinct characteristics that influence how they determine decision boundaries and what mathematical properties they optimize for.

The concept of "margin" is particularly important - it refers to the distance between the decision boundary and the nearest data points from each class. Different classifiers treat this margin differently, which affects their generalization ability and robustness to noise.

## Solution

### Step 1: SVM maximizes the margin between classes
The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is explicitly designed to maximize the margin between classes.

![SVM Margin](../Images/L4_4_Quiz_5/svm_margin.png)

From our analysis:
```
SVM Coefficients: [ 0.39210596 -0.0807168 ]
SVM Intercept: 0.09015145621457668
Decision Boundary Equation: 0.3921*x1 + -0.0807*x2 + 0.0902 = 0
Margin width: 4.9959
```

SVMs find the hyperplane that maximizes the distance to the nearest data points from each class (called support vectors). The margin width (4.9959 in our example) is calculated as $\frac{2}{||w||}$ where $w$ is the weight vector.

The mathematical formulation of SVM optimization explicitly aims to maximize this margin while ensuring all points are correctly classified:

$$\min_{w,b} \frac{1}{2}||w||^2 \quad \text{subject to} \quad y_i(w^Tx_i + b) \geq 1 \quad \forall i$$

Therefore, statement 1 corresponds to (d) Support Vector Machine (SVM).

### Step 2: LDA uses class-conditional densities and Bayes' rule
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) uses a generative approach based on modeling the class-conditional densities as Gaussian distributions with equal covariance matrices.

![LDA Densities](../Images/L4_4_Quiz_5/lda_densities.png)

From our analysis:
```
LDA Coefficients: [5.31497736 4.08982703]
LDA Intercept: 0.47507597590560025
Class means: Class 0 = [-2, -2], Class 1 = [2, 2]
Shared covariance matrix: [[1, 0], [0, 1]]
```

LDA models:
- The class-conditional densities $p(x|y=c)$ as Gaussian distributions
- Each class has its own mean vector ([-2, -2] and [2, 2] in our example)
- All classes share the same covariance matrix ([[1, 0], [0, 1]] in our example)

LDA applies Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probability:
$$p(y=c|x) = \frac{p(x|y=c)p(y=c)}{p(x)}$$

Since the class-conditional densities are modeled as Gaussians with equal covariance matrices, the decision boundary becomes linear.

Therefore, statement 2 corresponds to (c) Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA).

### Step 3: Perceptron finds any separating boundary
The Perceptron algorithm simply aims to find any decision boundary that correctly separates the training points, without specifically optimizing the margin or using probabilistic interpretations.

![Perceptron Boundaries](../Images/L4_4_Quiz_5/perceptron_boundaries.png)

From our analysis:
```
Perceptron solution 1:
  Coefficients: [-1.2846*x1 + 1.3446*x2 + 1.0000 = 0
  
Perceptron solution 2:
  Coefficients: [-0.8509*x1 + 1.6698*x2 + 1.0000 = 0
  
Perceptron solution 3:
  Coefficients: [-0.3193*x1 + 2.1041*x2 + 1.0000 = 0
  
Perceptron solution 4:
  Coefficients: [-1.5863*x1 + 3.4018*x2 + 1.0000 = 0
  
Perceptron solution 5:
  Coefficients: [-0.7600*x1 + 1.8282*x2 + 2.0000 = 0
```

The Perceptron learning algorithm updates its weights whenever it misclassifies a training example:
$$w \leftarrow w + \eta y x$$

Where:
- $w$ is the weight vector
- $\eta$ is the learning rate
- $y$ is the true label
- $x$ is the feature vector

As shown in our visualization, different initializations (random states) lead to different decision boundaries, all of which correctly separate the classes but with different orientations. The algorithm stops once all training points are correctly classified, with no guarantee of finding the optimal boundary.

Therefore, statement 3 corresponds to (a) Perceptron.

### Step 4: Logistic Regression models posterior probability using sigmoid
Logistic Regression directly models the posterior probability $P(y|x)$ using the sigmoid function.

![Logistic Regression](../Images/L4_4_Quiz_5/logistic_regression_prob.png)
![Sigmoid Function](../Images/L4_4_Quiz_5/sigmoid_function.png)

From our analysis:
```
Logistic Regression Coefficients: [-1.21450618  2.62035317]
Logistic Regression Intercept: 2.0452270318395054
Decision Boundary Equation: -1.2145*x1 + 2.6204*x2 + 2.0452 = 0
```

In binary classification, Logistic Regression models the probability of class membership as:
$$P(y=1|x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(w^Tx + b)}}$$

Where:
- $w$ is the weight vector
- $b$ is the bias term
- $x$ is the feature vector

The sigmoid function transforms the real-valued output into a probability between 0 and 1. The decision boundary is where $P(y=1|x) = 0.5$, which corresponds to $w^Tx + b = 0$. This is shown in our visualization where the probability contours indicate the predicted probabilities across the feature space.

Therefore, statement 4 corresponds to (b) Logistic Regression.

### Step 5: LDA maximizes between-class to within-class scatter ratio
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) seeks to maximize the ratio of between-class scatter to within-class scatter.

![LDA Scatter Ratio](../Images/L4_4_Quiz_5/lda_scatter_ratio.png)

From our analysis:
```
Class means: Class 0 = [-1.78923835 -1.98211085], Class 1 = [2.08328613 2.16949163]
Overall mean: [0.14702389 0.09369039]
Within-class scatter matrix S_W:
[[150.38182299  26.8808269 ]
 [ 26.8808269   87.17729614]]
Between-class scatter matrix S_B:
[[374.91114587 401.92955598]
 [401.92955598 430.89507941]]
LDA projection direction: [-0.3984462  -0.91719171]
```

LDA finds the projection direction $w$ that maximizes:
$$J(w) = \frac{w^T S_B w}{w^T S_W w}$$

Where:
- $S_B$ is the between-class scatter matrix
- $S_W$ is the within-class scatter matrix

The between-class scatter matrix $S_B$ measures the distance between class means, while the within-class scatter matrix $S_W$ measures the spread of each class around its own mean. 

By maximizing this ratio, LDA seeks a projection where classes are well-separated (high between-class scatter) and compact (low within-class scatter). This is different from just focusing on maximizing the margin as in SVM.

Therefore, statement 5 corresponds to (c) Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA).
