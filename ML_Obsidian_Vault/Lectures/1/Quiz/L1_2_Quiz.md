# Lecture 1.2: Identifying Learning Problems Quiz

## Overview
This quiz contains 4 questions from different topics covered in section 1.2 of the lectures on Identifying Learning Problems.

## Question 1

### Problem Statement
For each of the following real-world scenarios, identify whether it is a classification, regression, clustering, or dimensionality reduction problem. Then formulate it as a learning task by specifying the input features, output variables, and the goal.

#### Task
1. Predicting the remaining useful life of aircraft engines based on sensor readings
2. Categorizing news articles into topics like politics, sports, entertainment, etc.
3. Identifying groups of similar customer profiles from demographic and purchasing data
4. Reducing the number of features in a high-dimensional gene expression dataset while preserving the most important patterns

For a detailed explanation of this problem, including learning problem categorization and formulation techniques, see [Question 1: Learning Problem Identification](L1_2_1_explanation.md).

## Question 2

### Problem Statement
Consider a business problem: A retail company wants to optimize its marketing strategy by targeting specific customer segments with personalized promotions.

#### Task
1. Formulate this as a machine learning problem 
2. Identify what type of learning problem this is
3. Specify what data you would need to address this problem
4. Describe how you would evaluate the success of your solution
5. Discuss potential challenges and limitations

For a detailed explanation of this problem, including business problem formulation and evaluation strategies, see [Question 2: Marketing Optimization Problem](L1_2_2_explanation.md).

## Question 3

### Problem Statement
Pattern recognition is a fundamental aspect of machine learning. For each of the following patterns, describe how you would approach recognizing them using machine learning techniques:

#### Task
1. Identifying handwritten digits (0-9)
2. Detecting fraudulent credit card transactions
3. Recognizing emotions in facial expressions
4. Identifying seasonal patterns in retail sales data

For a detailed explanation of this problem, including pattern recognition techniques and appropriate algorithms, see [Question 3: Pattern Recognition Approaches](L1_2_3_explanation.md).

## Question 4

### Problem Statement
Consider a healthcare application: Predicting whether a patient is likely to be readmitted to the hospital within 30 days after discharge.

#### Task
1. Formulate this as a specific type of machine learning problem
2. Identify the input features you would use (be specific)
3. Define the target variable precisely
4. Discuss the ethical considerations and potential biases in this application
5. Describe how you would validate the model before deployment in a clinical setting

For a detailed explanation of this problem, including healthcare machine learning applications and ethical considerations, see [Question 4: Healthcare Prediction Problem](L1_2_4_explanation.md).
