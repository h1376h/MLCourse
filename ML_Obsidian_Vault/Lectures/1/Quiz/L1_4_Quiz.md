# Lecture 1.4: Well-posed Learning Problems Quiz

## Overview
This quiz contains 4 questions from different topics covered in section 1.4 of the lectures on Well-posed Learning Problems.

## Question 1

### Problem Statement
For each of the following scenarios, determine whether it represents a well-posed machine learning problem. If not, explain why and suggest how it could be reformulated to become well-posed.

#### Task
1. Predicting tomorrow's stock prices based solely on the previous day's closing prices
2. Determining whether a medical image contains a tumor based on a dataset of labeled images
3. Creating an algorithm to "understand" the meaning of poetry
4. Predicting customer churn based on demographic information, usage patterns, and customer service interactions

For a detailed explanation of this problem, including well-posed problem criteria and reformulation strategies, see [Question 1: Identifying Well-posed Problems](L1_4_1_explanation.md).

## Question 2

### Problem Statement
Consider the following learning problem: Given a dataset of paintings by various artists, develop a model to predict the artist who created each painting.

#### Task
1. Identify the key components that make this a well-posed learning problem
2. Discuss potential challenges in the problem formulation
3. Specify what features you would extract from the paintings
4. Explain how you would evaluate the model's performance
5. Discuss how the problem changes if you need to identify works by artists not present in your training data

For a detailed explanation of this problem, including problem formulation components and feature extraction techniques, see [Question 2: Artist Prediction Problem](L1_4_2_explanation.md).

## Question 3

### Problem Statement
A well-posed learning problem should have a clear performance measure that can be optimized.

#### Task
1. For a spam email classification system, discuss appropriate performance metrics and why they are suitable
2. For a recommendation system suggesting products to users, propose suitable performance metrics
3. For a regression problem predicting house prices, discuss which error metrics would be most appropriate and why
4. Explain the limitations of using accuracy as a performance measure for imbalanced classification problems

For a detailed explanation of this problem, including performance metrics selection and optimization strategies, see [Question 3: Performance Measures](L1_4_3_explanation.md).

## Question 4

### Problem Statement
Consider the following machine learning task: Develop a system to automatically grade essays written by students.

#### Task
1. Analyze whether this is a well-posed learning problem
2. Identify the key challenges in formulating this as a machine learning problem
3. Describe the input features and output variables you would use
4. Propose a methodology for evaluating the system's performance
5. Discuss the ethical considerations and potential biases in such a system

For a detailed explanation of this problem, including NLP techniques and ethical considerations in educational ML applications, see [Question 4: Automated Essay Grading](L1_4_4_explanation.md).
