# Lecture 1.1: Types of Learning Quiz

## Overview
This quiz contains 4 questions from different topics covered in section 1.1 of the lectures on Types of Learning.

## Question 1

### Problem Statement
For each of the following scenarios, identify the most appropriate type of machine learning approach (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement, or semi-supervised learning) and explain your reasoning:

#### Task
1. A robot learning to navigate through a maze by receiving rewards when it makes progress toward the exit and penalties when it hits walls
2. Grouping customers into different segments based on their purchasing behavior without any predefined categories
3. Training a system to predict housing prices based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and location using historical sales data
4. Training a spam detection system using a small set of labeled emails (spam/not spam) and a large set of unlabeled emails

For a detailed explanation of this problem, including characteristics of each learning type and their applications, see [Question 1: Types of Machine Learning](L1_1_1_explanation.md).

## Question 2

### Problem Statement
Consider a supervised learning problem for predicting whether a bank loan applicant will default on their loan.

#### Task
1. Identify whether this is a regression or classification problem and explain why
2. List at least 5 potential features (input variables) that would be useful for this prediction task
3. Describe what the training data would consist of
4. Explain how you would evaluate the performance of this model, including appropriate metrics

For a detailed explanation of this problem, including supervised learning concepts and model evaluation techniques, see [Question 2: Loan Default Prediction](L1_1_2_explanation.md).

## Question 3

### Problem Statement
Consider the following unsupervised learning problem: clustering customer transaction data to identify patterns of purchasing behavior.

#### Task
1. Explain the difference between hierarchical clustering and k-means clustering approaches for this problem
2. What are the key challenges in determining the optimal number of clusters?
3. How would you evaluate the quality of the resulting clusters without ground truth labels?
4. Describe a real-world business application where this clustering could provide actionable insights

For a detailed explanation of this problem, including clustering algorithms and evaluation metrics, see [Question 3: Customer Clustering Analysis](L1_1_3_explanation.md).

## Question 4

### Problem Statement
Consider a reinforcement learning problem where an agent is learning to play a video game.

#### Task
1. Define the key components of this reinforcement learning problem: states, actions, rewards, and policy
2. Explain the exploration-exploitation tradeoff in this context
3. Compare and contrast Q-learning and policy gradient methods for this application
4. How would the learning approach differ if the game has deterministic versus stochastic outcomes?

For a detailed explanation of this problem, including reinforcement learning fundamentals and algorithms, see [Question 4: Reinforcement Learning in Games](L1_1_4_explanation.md).
