- **Known mathematically**: Some games can be solved with game theory algorithms
- **Data available**: All possible states can be enumerated (for simple games)
- **Verdict**: ❌ Better solved with algorithmic approaches for games with perfect information

### 8. Financial Market Analysis
**Problem Description:** Investors analyze market trends to make trading decisions. Markets reflect countless factors including company performance, economic indicators, and investor sentiment.

- **Pattern exists**: Market movements may follow patterns based on various factors
- **Not known mathematically**: If a perfect mathematical model existed, markets would adjust
- **Data available**: Historical market data, news, economic indicators
- **Verdict**: ✅ Learning problem, but challenging due to noise and efficient market hypothesis

### 9. Mathematical Computation
**Problem Description:** Some tasks involve applying established mathematical formulas to input values, such as calculating compound interest, determining the area of shapes, or solving algebraic equations.

- **Pattern exists**: Yes, mathematical rules are patterns
- **Known mathematically**: We have exact formulas (e.g., compound interest)
- **Data available**: Not needed when we have the formula
- **Verdict**: ❌ Not a learning problem, use the formula directly

### 10. Email Classification
**Problem Description:** Every day, people receive various types of emails mixed together in their inbox. Different types of emails may share certain characteristics. The question is whether we can automatically categorize these emails.

- **Pattern exists**: Emails of different categories may share common characteristics (words, phrases, sender patterns)
- **Not known mathematically**: No exact mathematical formula defines what makes an email belong to a specific category
- **Data available**: Large datasets of labeled emails exist
- **Verdict**: ✅ Good machine learning problem

### 11. Customer Churn Prediction
**Problem Description:** Businesses want to identify which customers are likely to leave their service before they actually do. Customer behavior before leaving might follow certain patterns that could be analyzed.

- **Pattern exists**: Customers who leave often exhibit similar behaviors before churning
- **Not known mathematically**: The exact combination of factors leading to churn is complex and varies
- **Data available**: Historical records of customer behavior and churn status
- **Verdict**: ✅ Good machine learning problem

### 12. Simple Decision Making
**Problem Description:** Some decisions follow straightforward criteria, such as determining if a value exceeds a threshold or falls within a specific range.

- **Pattern exists**: Yes, but it's straightforward
- **Known mathematically**: Can be expressed as simple if-then rules
- **Data available**: May have data but not necessary
- **Verdict**: ❌ Better solved with rule-based programming

### 13. Atmospheric Prediction
**Problem Description:** Forecasting weather conditions involves analyzing atmospheric data to anticipate temperature, precipitation, and other meteorological conditions.

- **Pattern exists**: Yes, weather follows physical laws
- **Known mathematically**: Partially - physics equations exist but are too complex to solve precisely
- **Data available**: Abundant historical and real-time data
- **Verdict**: ✅ Hybrid approach works best - physical models enhanced with ML

## Quiz Example

### Problem Statement
Evaluate whether the following scenario is a good machine learning problem:

A restaurant chain wants to predict how many staff members they should schedule for each hour of each day at each location. They want to minimize labor costs while ensuring good customer service.

Using the three criteria for identifying a learning problem, analyze this scenario and determine if machine learning is an appropriate approach.

### Solution

**Problem Analysis: Restaurant Staffing Optimization**

1. **Does a pattern exist?**
   - Yes, customer traffic typically follows patterns based on:
     - Time of day (lunch/dinner rushes)
     - Day of week (weekends vs. weekdays)
     - Seasonal variations
     - Local events
     - Weather conditions
     - Holidays

2. **Is it known mathematically?**
   - No, there's no simple mathematical formula that can accurately predict customer traffic
   - The interactions between different factors are complex
   - Human behavior doesn't follow precise mathematical rules
   - Each location has unique patterns that can't be captured in a single formula

3. **Is data available?**
   - Yes, the restaurant chain likely has:
     - Historical sales data timestamped by hour/day/location
     - Past staffing levels and their impact on service quality
     - Customer feedback correlated with staffing levels
     - Wait times during different periods
     - Local event calendars
     - Weather records

**Verdict**: ✅ Good machine learning problem

This is an excellent candidate for machine learning because it involves finding complex patterns in data that can't be easily described with simple rules or formulas. The relationship between staffing needs and the various factors that influence customer traffic requires learning from historical data to make accurate predictions.
