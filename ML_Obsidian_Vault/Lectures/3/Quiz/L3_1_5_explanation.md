# Question 5: Gauss-Markov Theorem and BLUE

## Problem Statement
In the context of the Gauss-Markov theorem, consider the Best Linear Unbiased Estimator (BLUE).

### Task
1. List three key assumptions of the Gauss-Markov theorem
2. Explain what "unbiased" means in the context of BLUE
3. Why is the OLS estimator considered "best" among all linear unbiased estimators?

## Understanding the Problem
The Gauss-Markov theorem is a fundamental result in statistical theory that establishes the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimator as the Best Linear Unbiased Estimator (BLUE) under certain conditions. Understanding this theorem is crucial for regression analysis because it provides theoretical justification for using OLS as our estimation method of choice when specific assumptions are met.

This problem focuses on three key aspects of the Gauss-Markov framework:
1. The underlying assumptions required for the theorem to hold
2. The meaning of "unbiasedness" in estimation
3. The specific sense in which OLS is considered "best" among unbiased estimators

By exploring these concepts, we can gain deeper insights into why OLS is so widely used in statistical modeling and under what circumstances we might need to consider alternative estimation approaches.

## Solution

### Step 1: Key Assumptions of the Gauss-Markov Theorem
The Gauss-Markov theorem relies on five key assumptions about the linear regression model. Here are the most important ones:

1. **Linearity**: The relationship between predictors and the response is linear in parameters.
   - This means that the model can be expressed as $y = X\beta + \varepsilon$, where $y$ is the response vector, $X$ is the design matrix, $\beta$ is the parameter vector, and $\varepsilon$ is the error term.
   - Mathematically, we assume $E[y|X] = X\beta$, meaning the expected value of $y$ given $X$ is a linear function of the parameters.

2. **Random Sampling**: The data represents a random sample from the population.
   - This implies that observations are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.).
   - The model should not have systematic patterns in how observations are collected.

3. **No Perfect Multicollinearity**: There are no exact linear relationships among the predictor variables.
   - The design matrix $X$ must have full column rank, meaning that $(X'X)$ is invertible.
   - This ensures that the OLS estimator $\hat{\beta} = (X'X)^{-1}X'y$ can be uniquely determined.

4. **Exogeneity/Zero Conditional Mean**: The errors have zero mean conditional on $X$.
   - $E[\varepsilon|X] = 0$
   - This implies that the predictors are uncorrelated with the error term, which is critical for unbiasedness.

5. **Homoscedasticity**: The errors have constant variance.
   - $\text{Var}(\varepsilon|X) = \sigma^2I$
   - This means that the error variance is the same for all observations, regardless of the values of the predictors.

Importantly, the Gauss-Markov theorem does not require the assumption of normally distributed errors. The normality assumption is only needed for inference procedures like hypothesis testing and confidence intervals, not for the BLUE property itself.

### Step 2: What "Unbiased" Means in the Context of BLUE

An estimator $\hat{\beta}$ is unbiased if its expected value equals the true parameter value $\beta$:

$$E[\hat{\beta}] = \beta$$

In other words, if we could repeatedly sample data from the same population and compute the estimator each time, the average of these estimates would converge to the true parameter value. Unbiasedness is a desirable property because it means our estimation procedure doesn't systematically overestimate or underestimate the true parameter.

For the OLS estimator $\hat{\beta} = (X'X)^{-1}X'y$, we can prove unbiasedness as follows:

1. Substitute $y = X\beta + \varepsilon$ into the formula for $\hat{\beta}$:
   $$\hat{\beta} = (X'X)^{-1}X'(X\beta + \varepsilon) = (X'X)^{-1}X'X\beta + (X'X)^{-1}X'\varepsilon$$

2. Simplify using the fact that $(X'X)^{-1}X'X = I$ (the identity matrix):
   $$\hat{\beta} = \beta + (X'X)^{-1}X'\varepsilon$$

3. Take expectations:
   $$E[\hat{\beta}] = E[\beta + (X'X)^{-1}X'\varepsilon] = \beta + (X'X)^{-1}X'E[\varepsilon]$$

4. Given our assumption that $E[\varepsilon|X] = 0$, we have $E[\varepsilon] = 0$, so:
   $$E[\hat{\beta}] = \beta$$

This proves that the OLS estimator is unbiased.

The concept of unbiasedness can be visualized by comparing different estimators:

In this visualization:
- The OLS estimator (blue) is centered around the true parameter value (red line)
- Two biased estimators (green and purple) systematically deviate from the true value
- While individual OLS estimates may differ from the true value due to sampling variation, they don't systematically err in one direction

### Step 3: Why OLS is "Best" Among Linear Unbiased Estimators

In the context of the Gauss-Markov theorem, "best" has a specific statistical meaning: the OLS estimator has minimum variance among all linear unbiased estimators. This is why it's called the Best Linear Unbiased Estimator (BLUE).

To understand this:

1. Consider any linear estimator of the form $\tilde{\beta} = Cy$, where $C$ is any $p \times n$ matrix. 

2. For this estimator to be unbiased, we need $E[\tilde{\beta}] = \beta$ for all $\beta$, which implies that $C$ must satisfy $CX = I$.

3. The Gauss-Markov theorem proves that among all such unbiased linear estimators, the OLS estimator $\hat{\beta} = (X'X)^{-1}X'y$ has the smallest variance.

4. Specifically, for any other unbiased linear estimator $\tilde{\beta}$, we have:
   $$\text{Var}(\hat{\beta}) \leq \text{Var}(\tilde{\beta})$$
   in the positive semi-definite sense. This means that the matrix $\text{Var}(\tilde{\beta}) - \text{Var}(\hat{\beta})$ is positive semi-definite.

5. This minimum variance property is crucial because it means OLS gives us the most precise estimates possible (smallest standard errors) among all linear unbiased estimators.

The distribution of an OLS estimator compared to another unbiased estimator with higher variance can be visualized:

![BLUE Property Visualization](../Images/L3_1_Quiz_5/blue_property.png)

In this visualization:
- Both estimators are centered at the true parameter value (unbiased)
- The OLS estimator (blue) has a narrower distribution, indicating lower variance
- Lower variance means more precision and a higher probability of estimates close to the true value

This is the essence of the "best" property in BLUE â€“ OLS provides the most efficient use of the available data among all unbiased linear estimators.

### Step 4: Practical Implications of the Gauss-Markov Theorem

The Gauss-Markov theorem has several important practical implications for statistical modeling:

1. **Justification for OLS**: The theorem provides theoretical justification for using OLS as the default estimation method when its assumptions are reasonably satisfied.

2. **Diagnostic Importance**: It highlights the importance of checking model assumptions through diagnostic plots and tests. Violations of assumptions may necessitate corrections or alternative methods.

3. **Efficiency**: OLS makes the most efficient use of the available data among unbiased estimators, leading to more precise parameter estimates and narrower confidence intervals.

4. **Decision Framework**: When assumptions are violated, it provides a framework for deciding whether to transform the data, use robust standard errors, or consider alternative estimators.

5. **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**: It helps us understand the fundamental tradeoff between bias and variance in estimation. In some cases, slightly biased estimators (like ridge regression) may have lower mean squared error due to variance reduction.

## Practical Implementation

### Example: Comparing OLS with Other Estimators

Let's compare the performance of OLS with other estimators in a simulation setting:

1. **Generating Data**: 
   - Generate data from a true linear model: $y = X\beta + \varepsilon$
   - Sample multiple datasets from this model to evaluate estimator properties

2. **Calculating Estimators**:
   - OLS: $\hat{\beta}_{OLS} = (X'X)^{-1}X'y$
   - Another unbiased estimator with higher variance
   - A biased estimator (like ridge regression)

3. **Comparing Properties**:
   - Bias: Check if the average estimate equals the true parameter value
   - Variance: Measure the spread of estimates around their mean
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE): Combine bias and variance as $\text{MSE} = \text{Bias}^2 + \text{Variance}$

The simulation confirms the theoretical results:
- OLS is unbiased with minimum variance among unbiased estimators
- Other unbiased estimators have higher variance
- Some biased estimators may have lower MSE due to variance reduction, despite their bias
