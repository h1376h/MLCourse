# Question 13: Multiple Linear Regression Concepts

## Problem Statement
Evaluate whether each of the following statements is TRUE or FALSE. Justify your answer with a brief explanation.

1. In a multiple linear regression model, if features $x_1$ and $x_2$ are perfectly correlated (correlation coefficient = 1), then $(\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X})$ will be singular (non-invertible).
2. When encoding a categorical variable with $k$ categories using dummy variables, you always need exactly $k$ dummy variables.
3. Adding a polynomial term (e.g., $x^2$) to a regression model always improves the model's fit to the training data.
4. In multiple linear regression, the normal equation $\mathbf{w} = (\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{y}$ provides the global minimum of the sum of squared errors cost function.
5. If a predictor variable has no effect on the response, its coefficient in a multiple regression model will always be exactly zero.
6. In a multiple regression model with interaction terms, the coefficient of a main effect (e.g., $x_1$) represents the effect of that variable when all interacting variables are zero.
7. Radial basis functions are useful only for problems with exactly two input dimensions.
8. The curse of dimensionality refers exclusively to computational complexity issues when fitting models with many features.

## Understanding the Problem
This question evaluates understanding of key concepts in multiple linear regression, including multicollinearity, categorical variable encoding, model fitting, interaction terms, and dimensionality issues. A solid grasp of linear algebra and statistical principles is needed to correctly assess each statement.

## Solution

### Statement 1: Perfect Correlation and Matrix Singularity

#### Analysis
When two features $x_1$ and $x_2$ in a regression model are perfectly correlated (i.e., correlation coefficient = 1), they exhibit perfect linear dependence. This means one feature can be expressed as a linear function of the other (e.g., $x_2 = ax_1$ for some constant $a$).

In matrix form, this linear dependence means that one column of the design matrix $\mathbf{X}$ is a scalar multiple of another. When we compute $\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X}$ (a crucial step in solving the normal equation for regression), this linear dependence is preserved, resulting in a singular (non-invertible) matrix.

![Perfect Correlation](../Images/L3_4_Q13/1_perfect_correlation.png)

The visualization shows:
- Left: Perfectly correlated variables forming an exact linear relationship
- Right: Slightly imperfect correlation with minor deviations from linearity

We can further visualize different levels of multicollinearity with a correlation matrix:

![Correlation Matrix](../Images/L3_4_Q13/additional_correlation_matrix.png)

This correlation matrix illustrates:
- $X_1$ and $X_2$ have near-zero correlation (independent variables)
- $X_3$ shows moderate correlation with $X_1$ (correlation ≈ 0.5)
- $X_4$ exhibits strong correlation with $X_1$ (correlation ≈ 0.9)
- $X_5$ demonstrates perfect correlation with $X_1$ (correlation = 1.0)

Multicollinearity becomes problematic as correlation approaches 1.0, with perfect correlation causing the most severe issues.

Mathematically, a singular matrix has a determinant of zero, which our simulation confirmed for the perfectly correlated case:
- Determinant of $\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X}$ (perfect correlation): $0.0$
- Determinant of $\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X}$ (imperfect correlation): $7215.06$

The singularity of $\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X}$ has crucial implications for regression:
- The normal equation $(\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X})^{-1} \mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{y}$ cannot be solved uniquely
- Infinite possible coefficient vectors satisfy the equations
- Standard least squares estimation breaks down

This situation is a severe case of multicollinearity, which makes coefficient estimates unstable and unreliable.

#### Verdict
Statement 1 is **TRUE**. Perfect correlation between features in a multiple linear regression model makes $\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X}$ singular (non-invertible), preventing unique least squares solutions.

### Statement 2: Dummy Variables for Categorical Variables

#### Analysis
When incorporating a categorical variable with $k$ categories into a regression model, we need to create dummy variables to represent the categorical information numerically.

There are two common approaches:
1. One-hot encoding ($k$ dummy variables): Creates a binary variable for each category
2. Reference encoding ($k-1$ dummy variables): Uses one category as a reference level, creating binary variables only for the remaining categories

![Dummy Variables](../Images/L3_4_Q13/2_dummy_variables.png)

The fundamental issue is that using $k$ dummy variables with an intercept creates perfect multicollinearity, often called the "dummy variable trap." This is because the sum of all $k$ dummy variables equals 1 for every observation, making them linearly dependent with the intercept.

In our simulation:
- We created a categorical variable with 4 categories
- Using all 4 dummy variables (without intercept) allowed us to fit a model
- Using 3 dummy variables plus an intercept also allowed us to fit a model
- The effects were equivalent but parameterized differently:
  * With $k$ dummies: Each coefficient directly represents the mean effect of its category
  * With $k-1$ dummies: The intercept represents the reference category, and other coefficients represent differences from that reference

To avoid the dummy variable trap, statisticians typically use $k-1$ dummy variables, making one category the reference level represented by the intercept.

#### Verdict
Statement 2 is **FALSE**. When encoding a categorical variable with $k$ categories, you need at most $k-1$ dummy variables, not $k$, to avoid perfect multicollinearity when an intercept is included in the model.

### Statement 3: Adding Polynomial Terms and Model Fit

#### Analysis
Adding polynomial terms (like $x^2$) to a regression model increases its flexibility and allows it to capture non-linear relationships. However, it's incorrect to claim that this always improves the fit to training data.

We examined three scenarios:
1. Data with a true linear relationship ($y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \text{error}$)
2. Data with a true quadratic relationship ($y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \beta_2 x^2 + \text{error}$)
3. Data with a true cubic relationship ($y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \beta_3 x^3 + \text{error}$)

![Polynomial Terms](../Images/L3_4_Q13/3_polynomial_terms.png)

Our findings show:
- For linear data: Adding polynomial terms produced minimal improvement and eventually just fit noise
  * MSE with degree 1: $0.2037$
  * MSE with degree 5: $0.1907$
- For quadratic data: Adding a quadratic term dramatically improved fit, but higher terms helped little
  * MSE with degree 1: $1.9749$
  * MSE with degree 2: $0.2231$
  * MSE with degree 5: $0.2109$
- For cubic data: Adding a cubic term was necessary to capture the relationship
  * MSE with degree 2: $0.9773$
  * MSE with degree 3: $0.2802$

While adding polynomial terms may improve training fit, it often leads to overfitting. The following visualization demonstrates the gap between training and test performance as polynomial degree increases:

![Overfitting with Polynomials](../Images/L3_4_Q13/additional_overfitting_polynomial.png)

The visualization reveals critical insights:
- Top plot: Training error continually decreases with higher polynomial degrees, while test error initially decreases but then increases due to overfitting
- Bottom plot: Higher-degree polynomials (degrees 5 and 10) fit the training data better but create unrealistic wiggles in regions with sparse data
- The true underlying model is quadratic (degree 2), which achieves the best generalization (lowest test error)
- Beyond degree 2, more complex models begin overfitting, capturing noise rather than the true pattern

The benefit of adding polynomial terms depends on:
1. The true underlying relationship in the data
2. The signal-to-noise ratio
3. The specific polynomial terms added

Adding unnecessary polynomial terms:
- May lead to overfitting (models that capture noise rather than signal)
- Increases model complexity without substantial benefit
- May reduce model interpretability

#### Verdict
Statement 3 is **FALSE**. Adding polynomial terms to a regression model does not always improve the model's fit to training data. The benefit depends on the true underlying relationship and may lead to overfitting if the relationship is simpler than the polynomial order.

### Statement 4: Normal Equation and Global Minimum

#### Analysis
The normal equation in multiple linear regression is:

$$\mathbf{w} = (\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X})^{-1} \mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{y}$$

This equation provides a closed-form solution for the weights that minimize the sum of squared errors (SSE) cost function. To determine whether this solution is a global minimum, we analyzed the properties of the SSE cost function.

![Normal Equation](../Images/L3_4_Q13/4_normal_equation.png)

Key findings:
1. The sum of squared errors cost function is convex (has a bowl-like shape)
2. The Hessian matrix (second derivative) is positive definite, confirming convexity
   * Eigenvalues of the Hessian were all positive: $[147.42, 198.22]$
3. A convex function has exactly one critical point (where gradient = 0), which is the global minimum
4. The normal equation directly solves for this critical point

Convexity is a crucial property that guarantees:
- No local minima (only one global minimum)
- Any critical point is the global minimum
- Gradient descent algorithms will converge to the same solution from any starting point

Our contour plot clearly shows a single minimum in the parameter space, with the normal equation solution precisely at that point.

In more complex models with non-linear parameters, closed-form solutions may not exist, but for standard multiple linear regression, the normal equation provides the exact global minimum in a single computation step.

#### Verdict
Statement 4 is **TRUE**. The normal equation $\mathbf{w} = (\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X})^{-1} \mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{y}$ provides the global minimum of the sum of squared errors cost function because the function is convex.

### Statement 5: Coefficients of Predictor Variables with No Effect

#### Analysis
Intuitively, one might expect that a predictor with no effect on the response would have a coefficient of exactly zero in a regression model. However, due to sampling variability and noise, this is rarely the case in practice.

We simulated data with a predictor that had no true effect (coefficient = 0) and examined what happened when we estimated the model:

![Zero Coefficient](../Images/L3_4_Q13/5_zero_coefficient.png)

Key observations:
1. The true coefficient was $0$, but the estimated coefficient was $-0.0501$
2. The 95% confidence interval for this coefficient was $[-0.1313, 0.0374]$
3. While this interval contained $0$ (suggesting the variable might indeed have no effect), the point estimate was non-zero

We also examined how sample size and noise affected these estimates:
- Larger sample sizes brought estimates closer to zero on average
- Higher noise levels increased the variability of estimates
- Even with large samples and low noise, estimates were rarely exactly zero

This demonstrates that:
- Sampling variability ensures that coefficients are almost never exactly zero, even when the true effect is zero
- Statistical significance (whether 0 is in the confidence interval) is more important than whether the coefficient is exactly zero
- Only with infinite data or no noise would we expect to get exactly zero

In practice, researchers use:
- Hypothesis testing to determine if a coefficient is significantly different from zero
- Confidence intervals to estimate the range of plausible values for the true coefficient
- Model selection techniques to decide whether to include a variable

#### Verdict
Statement 5 is **FALSE**. If a predictor variable has no effect on the response, its coefficient in a multiple regression model will not always be exactly zero in practice due to sampling variability and noise.

### Statement 6: Interpretation of Main Effects with Interaction Terms

#### Analysis
When a regression model includes interaction terms (e.g., $x_1 x_2$), the interpretation of the coefficients for the main effects ($x_1$, $x_2$) changes substantially.

We simulated data from the model:

$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_3 x_1 x_2 + \varepsilon$$

![Interaction Terms](../Images/L3_4_Q13/6_interaction_terms.png)

With interaction terms:
- The coefficient $\beta_1$ represents the effect of $x_1$ when $x_2 = 0$
- The coefficient $\beta_2$ represents the effect of $x_2$ when $x_1 = 0$
- The total effect of $x_1$ varies depending on the value of $x_2$ according to: $\beta_1 + \beta_3 x_2$

Our simulation demonstrated this clearly:
- The coefficient for $x_1$ was $1.93$
- When $x_2 = 0$, the effect of $x_1$ was $1.93$ (just the main effect)
- When $x_2 = -2$, the effect of $x_1$ was $-1.23$ (main effect plus interaction)
- When $x_2 = 2$, the effect of $x_1$ was $5.09$ (main effect plus interaction)

This conditional interpretation:
- Differs from models without interactions, where coefficients represent average effects
- Makes center-scaling predictor variables important for interpretability
- Explains why the effect of one variable can depend on the values of others

The 3D visualization and varying slopes in our plot clearly show how the effect of one variable changes across different values of the interacting variable.

#### Verdict
Statement 6 is **TRUE**. In a multiple regression model with interaction terms, the coefficient of a main effect represents the effect of that variable when all interacting variables are zero.

### Statement 7: Radial Basis Functions and Input Dimensions

#### Analysis
Radial Basis Functions (RBFs) are a class of functions that measure distance from a center point, commonly used in function approximation, classification, and regression. A common form is the Gaussian RBF:

$$\phi(\mathbf{x}) = \exp\left(-\frac{\|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{c}\|^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)$$

We tested RBFs in multiple dimensions:

![Radial Basis Functions](../Images/L3_4_Q13/7_radial_basis_functions.png)

Our implementation demonstrated:
1. 1D example: Successfully approximated a sine wave using 3 RBF centers
2. 2D example: Approximated a complex surface using 5 RBF centers
3. 3D example: Used 9 RBF centers to approximate a 3D function

The key insights:
- RBFs compute distance from a center point in any dimensional space
- The Gaussian kernel transforms this distance into a similarity measure
- The dimensionality of the input space only affects how distances are computed
- RBFs can be used in spaces of any dimension, not just 2D

Real-world applications include:
- Function approximation in any number of dimensions
- Time series prediction (1D)
- Image processing (2D)
- Medical imaging and geospatial analysis (3D)
- Financial modeling and other high-dimensional problems (many dimensions)

The $R^2$ values in our examples were comparable across dimensions, confirming their utility in spaces of varying dimensionality.

#### Verdict
Statement 7 is **FALSE**. Radial basis functions are not limited to problems with exactly two input dimensions; they can be applied effectively to problems of any dimensionality.

### Statement 8: The Curse of Dimensionality

#### Analysis
The "curse of dimensionality" refers to various phenomena that arise when analyzing data in high-dimensional spaces. While computational complexity is one aspect, it encompasses many other challenges.

![Curse of Dimensionality](../Images/L3_4_Q13/8_curse_of_dimensionality.png)

Our analysis revealed multiple aspects of the curse:

1. **Volume increases exponentially with dimensions**
   - The volume of a unit hypercube remains 1 in any dimension
   - The volume of a unit hypersphere rapidly approaches 0 as dimensions increase
   - This creates vast empty spaces in high dimensions

2. **Data sparsity**
   - Average distance between random points increases with dimensionality
   - The same number of points covers a much smaller fraction of the space in higher dimensions
   - Points needed for adequate coverage grow exponentially ($10^d$ for $d$ dimensions)

3. **Distance concentration**
   - In high dimensions, distances between points tend to become more similar
   - The ratio of farthest to nearest neighbor distances approaches 1
   - This makes nearest-neighbor approaches less effective

4. **Statistical challenges**
   - Estimation becomes less reliable as dimensions increase
   - More training data is required to maintain the same estimation accuracy
   - Risk of overfitting increases dramatically

These issues persist even with unlimited computational power and affect fundamental aspects of statistical learning:
- The reliability of similarity measures
- The effectiveness of density estimation
- The need for regularization and dimensionality reduction
- The generalization ability of learned models

#### Verdict
Statement 8 is **FALSE**. The curse of dimensionality refers to various phenomena beyond just computational complexity, including data sparsity, distance concentration, and statistical challenges that arise in high-dimensional spaces.
