# MAP Formula Examples

This document provides practical examples of Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation for various real-world applications, demonstrating the mathematical formulas and calculations involved in finding MAP estimates.

## Key Concepts and Formulas

For estimating the mean of a normal distribution with known variance, the MAP formula is:

$$\hat{\mu}_{MAP} = \frac{\mu_0 + \frac{\sigma_0^2}{\sigma^2}\sum_{i=1}^N x^{(i)}}{1 + \frac{\sigma_0^2}{\sigma^2}N}$$

This can be simplified by defining the variance ratio $r = \frac{\sigma_0^2}{\sigma^2}$:

$$\hat{\mu}_{MAP} = \frac{\mu_0 + r \sum_{i=1}^N x^{(i)}}{1 + r \times N}$$

Where:
- $\hat{\mu}_{MAP}$ = MAP estimate
- $\mu_0$ = Prior mean
- $\sigma_0^2$ = Prior variance 
- $\sigma^2$ = Data variance
- $\sum_{i=1}^N x^{(i)}$ = Sum of observations
- $N$ = Number of observations
- $r$ = Variance ratio

## Examples

The following examples demonstrate MAP estimation for different real-world applications:

- **Student Height**: Estimating average height of students in a class
- **Online Learning Scores**: Estimating a student's true skill level 
- **Manufacturing Process**: Quality control in component production
- **Sensor Measurement**: Estimating true temperature with error-prone sensors
- **Student Skill Level**: Estimating true skill from quiz scores
- **Weather Forecasting**: Estimating temperature from multiple sensors
- **Manufacturing QC**: Monitoring bearing diameter in production
- **Thermometer Calibration**: Estimating measurement bias

### Example 1: Student Height

#### Problem Statement
We want to estimate the average height of students in a class based on prior knowledge and a small sample of measured heights.

Given:
- Prior belief about average student height: $\mu_0 = 170$ cm
- Prior variance: $\sigma_0^2 = 25$ cm²
- Observed heights from five randomly selected students: $[165, 173, 168, 180, 172]$ cm
- Known population variance: $\sigma^2 = 20$ cm²

Calculate the MAP estimate for the true average height of students in the class.

#### Solution

We'll apply the MAP formula to combine our prior belief with the observed heights.

##### Step 1: Define the prior and data parameters
- Prior mean: $\mu_0 = 170$ cm
- Prior variance: $\sigma_0^2 = 25$ cm²
- Observed heights: $[165, 173, 168, 180, 172]$ cm
- Number of observations: $N = 5$
- Data variance: $\sigma^2 = 20$ cm²

$$r = \frac{\sigma_0^2}{\sigma^2} = \frac{25}{20} = 1.25$$

##### Step 2: Calculate the MAP estimate
$$\hat{\mu}_{MAP} = \frac{\mu_0 + r \sum_{i=1}^N x^{(i)}}{1 + r \times N} = \frac{170 + 1.25 \times 858}{1 + 1.25 \times 5} = \frac{1242.5}{7.25} = 171.38 \text{ cm}$$

Therefore, our best estimate of the true average height is 171.38 cm, which lies between our prior belief (170 cm) and the sample mean (171.6 cm), slightly closer to the sample mean because we trust the data slightly more than our prior.

### Example 2: Online Learning Scores

#### Problem Statement
An online learning platform wants to estimate a student's true skill level based on prior knowledge of average scores and recent quiz results.

Given:
- Prior belief about average score for this difficulty level: $\mu_0 = 70$ (out of 100)
- Prior variance: $\sigma_0^2 = 100$
- Student's recent quiz scores: $[85, 82, 90, 88]$
- Known quiz score variance due to question variation: $\sigma^2 = 64$

Calculate the MAP estimate for the student's true skill level.

#### Solution

##### Step 1: Define the prior and data parameters
- Prior mean (average score): $\mu_0 = 70$ (out of 100)
- Prior variance: $\sigma_0^2 = 100$
- Observed scores: $[85, 82, 90, 88]$
- Number of observations: $N = 4$
- Data variance: $\sigma^2 = 64$

$$r = \frac{\sigma_0^2}{\sigma^2} = \frac{100}{64} = 1.5625$$

##### Step 2: Calculate the MAP estimate
$$\hat{\mu}_{MAP} = \frac{\mu_0 + r \sum_{i=1}^N x^{(i)}}{1 + r \times N} = \frac{70 + 1.5625 \times 345}{1 + 1.5625 \times 4} = \frac{609.06}{7.25} = 84.01$$

The MAP estimate of 84.01 suggests the student's true skill level is well above the average (70), but slightly below their recent performance average (86.25).

### Example 3: Manufacturing Process Quality Control

#### Problem Statement
A manufacturing company wants to estimate the true dimension of components in a production process using design specifications and actual measurements.

Given:
- Design specification (prior mean): $\mu_0 = 50$ mm
- Prior variance: $\sigma_0^2 = 0.04$ mm²
- Observed measurements from five randomly selected components: $[50.2, 50.3, 50.1, 50.25, 50.15]$ mm
- Known measurement error variance: $\sigma^2 = 0.01$ mm²

Calculate the MAP estimate for the true component dimension in the manufacturing process.

#### Solution

##### Step 1: Define the prior and data parameters
- Prior mean (design specification): $\mu_0 = 50$ mm
- Prior variance: $\sigma_0^2 = 0.04$ mm²
- Observed measurements: $[50.2, 50.3, 50.1, 50.25, 50.15]$ mm
- Number of observations: $N = 5$
- Data variance: $\sigma^2 = 0.01$ mm²

$$r = \frac{\sigma_0^2}{\sigma^2} = \frac{0.04}{0.01} = 4$$

##### Step 2: Calculate the MAP estimate
$$\hat{\mu}_{MAP} = \frac{\mu_0 + r \sum_{i=1}^N x^{(i)}}{1 + r \times N} = \frac{50 + 4 \times 251}{1 + 4 \times 5} = \frac{1054}{21} = 50.19 \text{ mm}$$

The MAP estimate of 50.19 mm indicates that the true component dimension is slightly larger than the design specification (50.0 mm), but within acceptable tolerance.

### Example 4: Sensor Measurement

#### Problem Statement
A building management system needs to estimate the true temperature in a room using a sensor with known error characteristics. The system combines expected temperature from weather forecast and building conditions with actual sensor readings.

Given:
- Expected temperature (prior mean): $\mu_0 = 25$ °C
- Prior variance: $\sigma_0^2 = 4$ °C²
- Observed temperature readings from the sensor: $[23, 24, 26]$ °C
- Known sensor error variance: $\sigma^2 = 1$ °C²

Calculate the MAP estimate for the true temperature in the room. What decision should be made for the temperature control system if the comfort zone is 22-26 °C?

#### Solution

##### Step 1: Define the prior and data parameters
- Prior mean (expected temperature): $\mu_0 = 25$ °C
- Prior variance: $\sigma_0^2 = 4$ °C²
- Observed readings: $[23, 24, 26]$ °C
- Number of observations: $N = 3$
- Sample mean: $\frac{23 + 24 + 26}{3} = 24.33$ °C
- Data variance: $\sigma^2 = 1$ °C²

$$r = \frac{\sigma_0^2}{\sigma^2} = \frac{4}{1} = 4$$

##### Step 2: Calculate the MAP estimate
$$\hat{\mu}_{MAP} = \frac{\mu_0 + r \sum_{i=1}^N x^{(i)}}{1 + r \times N} = \frac{25 + 4 \times 73}{1 + 4 \times 3} = \frac{317}{13} = 24.38 \text{ °C}$$

##### Step 3: Analysis and Interpretation
In this case, the variance ratio ($r = 4$) indicates we trust our sensor readings more than our prior expectation. The MAP estimate (24.38 °C) is closer to our sample mean (24.33 °C) than to our prior (25 °C), showing that the data has more influence on our final estimate.

For temperature control applications, knowing that the true temperature is likely around 24.38 °C (which falls within typical comfort zones of 22-26 °C) means no adjustment to heating or cooling systems is needed.

The above visualization shows the prior distribution (blue), likelihood from observed data (green), and posterior distribution (red). The vertical lines indicate the MAP estimate (black dashed) and MLE estimate (green dashed). The gray shaded region represents the comfort zone (22-26 °C).

### Example 5: Stock Return Prediction

#### Problem Statement
An investment analyst wants to estimate the true future stock return for a particular company based on historical data and recent performance.

Given:
- Historical average return (prior mean): $\mu_0 = 5.0\%$
- Prior variance: $\sigma_0^2 = 4$
- Recent observed daily returns: $[8.2, 7.5, 9.1, 7.8, 8.4, 7.9]\%$
- Known variance in daily returns: $\sigma^2 = 10$

Calculate the MAP estimate for the true stock return. How does this estimate compare to both the historical average and the recent average?

#### Solution

##### Step 1: Define the prior and data parameters
- Prior mean (historical average): $\mu_0 = 5.0\%$
- Prior variance: $\sigma_0^2 = 4$
- Observed returns: $[8.2, 7.5, 9.1, 7.8, 8.4, 7.9]\%$
- Number of observations: $N = 6$
- Sample mean: $\frac{8.2 + 7.5 + 9.1 + 7.8 + 8.4 + 7.9}{6} = 8.15\%$
- Data variance: $\sigma^2 = 10$

Variance ratio: $r = \frac{\sigma_0^2}{\sigma^2} = \frac{4}{10} = 0.4$

##### Step 2: Calculate the MAP estimate
$$\begin{align}
\hat{\mu}_{MAP} &= \frac{\mu_0 + r \times \sum_{i=1}^N x^{(i)}}{1 + r \times N} \\
&= \frac{5.0 + 0.4 \times 48.9}{1 + 0.4 \times 6} \\
&= \frac{5.0 + 19.56}{1 + 2.4} \\
&= \frac{24.56}{3.4} \\
&= 7.22\%
\end{align}$$

#### Analysis
The MAP estimate (7.22%) falls between the historical average (5.0%) and the recent average (8.15%), but is closer to the historical average. This is because the variance ratio is less than 1, indicating we trust our prior knowledge more than the new data.

This example demonstrates an important property of MAP estimation: when the variance ratio is less than 1, the MAP estimate is pulled more strongly toward the prior mean. This can be desirable in financial forecasting where recent fluctuations might not be as reliable as long-term trends.

![[stock_returns_map.png]]

In investment strategy, this MAP estimate would suggest that while recent returns have been higher than historical averages, a conservative approach would be to expect future returns closer to 7.22% rather than the more optimistic recent average of 8.15%.

### Example 6: Understanding the Variance Ratio

#### Problem Statement
A pharmaceutical company is evaluating the efficacy of a new drug in their clinical trials. They need to understand how different levels of uncertainty in prior knowledge and measurement accuracy affect the MAP estimate.

Given:
- Prior belief about drug efficacy score: $\mu_0 = 60$ (on a scale of 0-100)
- Prior variance: $\sigma_0^2 = 16$
- Observed efficacy scores from 4 patients: $[70, 75, 68, 73]$
- Measurement variance: $\sigma^2 = 4$

Calculate the MAP estimate for the drug's true efficacy score under the following three scenarios:
1. Original parameters as given above
2. Higher prior uncertainty: $\sigma_0^2 = 64$ (less confidence in prior)
3. Lower measurement error: $\sigma^2 = 1$ (more accurate measurements)

For each scenario, determine how the changing variance ratio affects the MAP estimate's proximity to either the prior mean or the sample mean.

#### Solution

##### Scenario 1: Original Parameters
- Prior mean: $\mu_0 = 60$ (prior belief)
- Prior variance: $\sigma_0^2 = 16$
- Observed scores: $[70, 75, 68, 73]$
- Sample mean: $\frac{70 + 75 + 68 + 73}{4} = 71.5$
- Data variance: $\sigma^2 = 4$
- Number of observations: $N = 4$

Variance ratio: $r = \frac{\sigma_0^2}{\sigma^2} = \frac{16}{4} = 4$

The MAP estimate:
$$\begin{align}
\hat{\mu}_{MAP} &= \frac{\mu_0 + r \times \sum_{i=1}^N x^{(i)}}{1 + r \times N} \\
&= \frac{60 + 4 \times 286}{1 + 4 \times 4} \\
&= \frac{60 + 1144}{1 + 16} \\
&= \frac{1204}{17} \\
&= 70.82
\end{align}$$

##### Scenario 2: Higher Prior Uncertainty (σ₀² = 64)
Variance ratio: $r = \frac{\sigma_0^2}{\sigma^2} = \frac{64}{4} = 16$

The MAP estimate:
$$\begin{align}
\hat{\mu}_{MAP} &= \frac{60 + 16 \times 286}{1 + 16 \times 4} \\
&= \frac{60 + 4576}{1 + 64} \\
&= \frac{4636}{65} \\
&= 71.32
\end{align}$$

##### Scenario 3: Lower Measurement Error (σ² = 1)
Variance ratio: $r = \frac{\sigma_0^2}{\sigma^2} = \frac{16}{1} = 16$

The MAP estimate:
$$\begin{align}
\hat{\mu}_{MAP} &= \frac{60 + 16 \times 286}{1 + 16 \times 4} \\
&= \frac{60 + 4576}{1 + 64} \\
&= \frac{4636}{65} \\
&= 71.32
\end{align}$$

#### Analysis
- In Scenario 1 (r = 4): The MAP estimate (70.82) lies between the prior (60) and sample mean (71.5), closer to the data.
- In Scenario 2 (r = 16): With higher prior uncertainty, the MAP estimate (71.32) moves closer to the sample mean.
- In Scenario 3 (r = 16): With lower measurement error, we also get r = 16 and the same MAP estimate as Scenario 2.

This demonstrates that the variance ratio is what matters in determining how much weight to give to the data versus the prior. Higher r values give more weight to the data, either because we're less certain about our prior (higher σ₀²) or more confident in our measurements (lower σ²).

![[variance_ratio_map.png]]

### Example 7: Convergence to MLE with Large Samples

#### Problem Statement
A retail analytics company wants to estimate the average customer spending at a store chain. As they collect more data, they want to understand how the influence of prior beliefs diminishes with increasing sample size.

Given:
- Prior belief about average customer spending: $\mu_0 = 80$ dollars
- Prior variance: $\sigma_0^2 = 25$ dollars²
- Known variance in individual customer spending: $\sigma^2 = 100$ dollars²
- Three different datasets representing different sample sizes:
  1. Small sample (N=3): $[95, 90, 105]$ dollars
  2. Medium sample (N=10): $[95, 90, 105, 98, 92, 101, 97, 94, 99, 103]$ dollars
  3. Large sample (N=100): This would be 100 observations with the same sample mean of $97.4$ dollars

Calculate the MAP estimate for each of the three sample sizes. How does the MAP estimate change as the sample size increases? Compare each MAP estimate with the corresponding MLE estimate (sample mean) and explain the relationship.

#### Solution

##### Small sample size (N = 3)
- Prior mean: $\mu_0 = 80$ (prior belief)
- Prior variance: $\sigma_0^2 = 25$
- Observed spending: $[95, 90, 105]$
- Sample mean: $\frac{95 + 90 + 105}{3} = 96.67$
- Data variance: $\sigma^2 = 100$
- Number of observations: $N = 3$

$$r = \frac{\sigma_0^2}{\sigma^2} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25$$

$$\hat{\mu}_{MAP} = \frac{80 + 0.25 \times 290}{1 + 0.25 \times 3} = \frac{80 + 72.5}{1 + 0.75} = \frac{152.5}{1.75} = 87.14$$

The MAP estimate (87.14) is significantly pulled toward the prior mean of 80.

##### Medium sample size (N = 10)
Now assume we have 10 customers with spending data: [95, 90, 105, 98, 92, 101, 97, 94, 99, 103]

Sample mean = 97.4

$$\hat{\mu}_{MAP} = \frac{80 + 0.25 \times 974}{1 + 0.25 \times 10} = \frac{80 + 243.5}{1 + 2.5} = \frac{323.5}{3.5} = 92.43$$

The MAP estimate (92.43) is closer to the sample mean.

##### Large sample size (N = 100)
With 100 customers and the same sample mean of 97.4:

$$\hat{\mu}_{MAP} = \frac{80 + 0.25 \times 9740}{1 + 0.25 \times 100} = \frac{80 + 2435}{1 + 25} = \frac{2515}{26} = 96.73$$

The MAP estimate (96.73) is now very close to the MLE estimate (sample mean = 97.4).

#### Analysis
As N increases, the MAP estimate converges to the sample mean (MLE estimate):
- N = 3: MAP = 87.14 (far from MLE = 96.67)
- N = 10: MAP = 92.43 (closer to MLE = 97.4)
- N = 100: MAP = 96.73 (very close to MLE = 97.4)

This demonstrates a key theoretical property of MAP estimation: as the sample size grows, the influence of the prior diminishes, and the data dominates the estimation.

### Example 8: When Prior and Data Conflict

#### Problem Statement
An education researcher faces a situation where new test data significantly conflicts with historical averages. The researcher needs to determine how different strengths of prior belief affect the MAP estimate when confronted with surprising evidence.

Given:
- Prior belief about average standardized test score: $\mu_0 = 75$ (out of 100)
- Prior variance: $\sigma_0^2 = 9$
- Observed test scores from a new cohort of 5 students: $[50, 55, 45, 52, 48]$
- Known test variance: $\sigma^2 = 16$

Calculate the MAP estimate for the true average test score using the given parameters. Then recalculate the MAP estimate under the following scenarios:
1. Weak prior (less confidence in historical data): $\sigma_0^2 = 36$
2. Strong prior (high confidence in historical data): $\sigma_0^2 = 4$

How does the strength of the prior belief affect the MAP estimate when the observed data strongly contradicts the prior? Which estimate would you recommend the researcher use, and why?

#### Solution

##### Step 1: Define the standard parameters
- Prior mean: $\mu_0 = 75$ (historical average)
- Prior variance: $\sigma_0^2 = 9$
- Observed scores: $[50, 55, 45, 52, 48]$
- Sample mean: $\frac{50 + 55 + 45 + 52 + 48}{5} = 50$
- Data variance: $\sigma^2 = 16$
- Number of observations: $N = 5$

##### Step 2: Calculate the variance ratio
$$r = \frac{\sigma_0^2}{\sigma^2} = \frac{9}{16} = 0.5625$$

##### Step 3: Calculate the MAP estimate
$$\begin{align}
\hat{\mu}_{MAP} &= \frac{\mu_0 + r \times \sum_{i=1}^N x^{(i)}}{1 + r \times N} \\
&= \frac{75 + 0.5625 \times 250}{1 + 0.5625 \times 5} \\
&= \frac{75 + 140.625}{1 + 2.8125} \\
&= \frac{215.625}{3.8125} \\
&= 56.56
\end{align}$$

##### Step 4: Alternative scenarios with different prior strengths

###### Weak prior (σ₀² = 36)
$$r = \frac{36}{16} = 2.25$$
$$\hat{\mu}_{MAP} = \frac{75 + 2.25 \times 250}{1 + 2.25 \times 5} = \frac{75 + 562.5}{1 + 11.25} = \frac{637.5}{12.25} = 52.04$$

###### Strong prior (σ₀² = 4)
$$r = \frac{4}{16} = 0.25$$
$$\hat{\mu}_{MAP} = \frac{75 + 0.25 \times 250}{1 + 0.25 \times 5} = \frac{75 + 62.5}{1 + 1.25} = \frac{137.5}{2.25} = 61.11$$

#### Analysis
- With standard prior (r = 0.5625): MAP = 56.56, between sample mean (50) and prior (75)
- With weak prior (r = 2.25): MAP = 52.04, closer to sample mean
- With strong prior (r = 0.25): MAP = 61.11, closer to prior mean

This example demonstrates how MAP handles the conflict between prior beliefs and observed data. The stronger our prior belief (smaller σ₀²), the more the MAP estimate resists changing despite contradicting evidence. Conversely, a weaker prior allows the estimate to adapt more readily to surprising data.

### Example 9: MAP Estimation in Medical Diagnosis

#### Problem Statement
A biotech company is developing a diagnostic test for a rare disease. They need to estimate the true sensitivity (true positive rate) of their test for regulatory approval.

Given:
- Prior belief about test sensitivity: $\mu_0 = 0.85$ (85%)
- Prior variance: $\sigma_0^2 = 0.0036$
- Clinical trial results: The test correctly identified 22 out of 30 patients known to have the disease
- Observed sample mean: $\frac{22}{30} = 0.733$ (73.3%)

Calculate the MAP estimate of the test's true sensitivity using:
1. The normal approximation approach
2. The more accurate Beta-Binomial approach (where the Beta prior parameters can be derived from the given mean and variance)

Which approach is more appropriate for this problem and why? Would you recommend this test for clinical use if the regulatory requirement is at least 80% sensitivity?

#### Solution

##### Step 1: Define the standard parameters
- Prior mean: $\mu_0 = 0.85$ (prior belief of true positive rate)
- Prior variance: $\sigma_0^2 = 0.0036$
- Observed data: 22 successes out of 30 trials
- Sample mean: $\frac{22}{30} = 0.7333$
- Data variance: $\sigma^2 = \frac{\theta(1-\theta)}{n} \approx \frac{0.85 \times 0.15}{30} = 0.00425$
- Number of observations: $N = 1$ (we treat the entire trial as a single observation)

##### Step 2: Calculate the variance ratio
$$r = \frac{\sigma_0^2}{\sigma^2} = \frac{0.0036}{0.00425} = 0.847$$

##### Step 3: Calculate the MAP estimate
For this Bernoulli scenario, we can still use the normal approximation:

$$\begin{align}
\hat{\theta}_{MAP} &= \frac{\mu_0 + r \times N \times \text{sample mean}}{1 + r \times N} \\
&= \frac{0.85 + 0.847 \times 1 \times 0.7333}{1 + 0.847 \times 1} \\
&= \frac{0.85 + 0.621}{1 + 0.847} \\
&= \frac{1.471}{1.847} \\
&= 0.7964
\end{align}$$

##### Step 4: Beta-Binomial analysis (more accurate for Bernoulli)
The normal approximation is convenient but not ideal for probabilities. A more precise approach would use a Beta prior with a Binomial likelihood:

If the prior mean is 0.85 and variance is 0.0036, this corresponds to a Beta distribution with parameters:
$$\alpha = 85.4, \beta = 15.1$$

The posterior is then Beta(85.4 + 22, 15.1 + 8) = Beta(107.4, 23.1)
The MAP estimate from this Beta posterior is:
$$\hat{\theta}_{MAP} = \frac{\alpha - 1}{\alpha + \beta - 2} = \frac{107.4 - 1}{107.4 + 23.1 - 2} = \frac{106.4}{128.5} = 0.828$$

#### Analysis
The MAP estimate of 0.80 (or 0.828 using the more precise Beta-Binomial approach) lies between the prior belief (0.85) and the observed rate (0.73). This balanced estimate would be crucial in determining whether the test meets clinical standards for sensitivity and whether additional studies are needed.

This example illustrates how MAP estimation can be applied to binomial problems like diagnostic testing, providing a principled way to update beliefs based on clinical trial results.

### Example 10: True/False Questions on MAP Estimation

#### Problem Statement
Evaluate whether each of the following statements is TRUE or FALSE. Justify your answer with a brief explanation.

1. As the number of observations increases to infinity, the MAP estimate will always converge to the Maximum Likelihood Estimate regardless of the prior distribution.
2. The regularization effect of MAP estimation comes from the prior distribution.
3. In the context of normal distributions with known variance, if the prior variance equals the data variance, the MAP estimate will always be the average of the prior mean and the sample mean.
4. MAP estimation is considered a "compromise" between MLE and pure Bayesian inference.
5. A higher variance ratio ($r = \frac{\sigma_0^2}{\sigma^2}$) in MAP estimation means we trust our prior more than the data.
6. The MAP estimate will always lie between the prior mean and the sample mean.

#### Solution

##### Statement 1

**Answer**: TRUE

**Explanation**: As $N$ approaches infinity, the influence of the prior diminishes, and the data dominates the estimation. This can be seen from the MAP formula where the term with the observations grows proportionally with $N$, eventually overwhelming the prior term.

##### Statement 2

**Answer**: TRUE

**Explanation**: In MAP estimation, the prior distribution acts as a regularizer that penalizes certain parameter values. This is why MAP estimation with a Gaussian prior on parameters corresponds to L2 regularization in machine learning models.

##### Statement 3

**Answer**: FALSE

**Explanation**: When prior variance equals data variance, the MAP estimate becomes a weighted average where the prior mean has weight 1 and each observation has weight 1. The result depends on the number of observations and is not simply the average of prior mean and sample mean.

##### Statement 4

**Answer**: TRUE

**Explanation**: While MLE only uses data and full Bayesian inference considers the entire posterior distribution, MAP combines prior information with data but still produces a point estimate, making it a middle ground between the two approaches.

##### Statement 5

**Answer**: FALSE

**Explanation**: A higher variance ratio means we trust the data more than the prior. The formula gives more weight to the data term when the prior variance is large relative to the data variance.

##### Statement 6

**Answer**: TRUE

**Explanation**: For normal distributions with known variance, the MAP estimate is a weighted average of the prior mean and sample mean, so it must lie between these two values.

- Forgetting to account for the variance of both the prior and the data
- Overconfidence in prior beliefs can lead to resistance to data evidence
- Misinterpreting the variance ratio's impact on weighting prior vs. data

## Running the Examples

You can run all the examples using:

```bash
