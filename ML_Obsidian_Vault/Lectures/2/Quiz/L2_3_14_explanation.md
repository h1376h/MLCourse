## Understanding the Problem
This question presents a visual exploration of several key concepts from statistical estimation theory:
- Log-likelihood functions and their properties
- Score functions and their role in maximum likelihood estimation
- Fisher Information and the Cramér-Rao bound
- Bias properties of different estimators
- The relationship between sample size and estimation precision

The exponential distribution with parameter $\lambda$ has probability density function:
$$f(x|\lambda) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}, \quad x \geq 0, \lambda > 0$$

The mean of this distribution is $1/\lambda$ and the variance is $1/\lambda^2$. The data used to generate these graphs was a random sample of size $n=100$ from this distribution with true parameter $\lambda = 2.0$.

## Solution

### Step 1: Understanding the Log-Likelihood Function

![Log-Likelihood Function with MLE Highlighted](../Images/L2_3_Quiz_14/solution_log_likelihood.png)

For an exponential distribution with parameter $\lambda$, the log-likelihood function for a sample of size $n$ is:

$$\ell(\lambda) = n \log(\lambda) - \lambda \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$$

From Graph 1, we can see that this function reaches its maximum at approximately $\lambda = 2.0$. This is the Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE) of $\lambda$.

**Answer to Question 1**: The approximate MLE of $\lambda$ is 2.0.

### Step 2: Analyzing the Score Function

![Score Function with Zero-Crossing at MLE](../Images/L2_3_Quiz_14/solution_score_function.png)

The score function is the derivative of the log-likelihood function with respect to the parameter:

$$S(\lambda) = \frac{d\ell(\lambda)}{d\lambda} = \frac{n}{\lambda} - \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$$

A key property of the score function is that it equals zero at the value of $\lambda$ that maximizes the log-likelihood function (the MLE).

From Graph 2, we can observe that the score function crosses zero at $\lambda \approx 2.0$, confirming our MLE from Graph 1.

**Answer to Question 2**: The score function is the first derivative of the log-likelihood function. It equals zero at the MLE because this is a critical point of the log-likelihood function (where the slope is zero). Graph 2 confirms that the score function crosses zero at $\lambda \approx 2.0$, verifying our MLE from Question 1.

### Step 3: Examining the Fisher Information

![Fisher Information Function](../Images/L2_3_Quiz_14/solution_fisher_information.png)

The Fisher Information quantifies how much information a sample provides about the parameter $\lambda$. For the exponential distribution, the Fisher Information is:

$$I(\lambda) = \frac{n}{\lambda^2}$$

From Graph 3, we can determine that the Fisher Information at $\lambda = 2.0$ is:

$$I(2.0) = \frac{100}{(2.0)^2} = \frac{100}{4} = 25$$

**Answer to Question 3**: The Fisher Information at $\lambda = 2.0$ is 25. This indicates that we can estimate $\lambda$ with reasonable precision. Higher Fisher Information means that we can achieve more precise estimates (lower variance).

### Step 4: Comparing Bias Properties

The bias of an estimator is the difference between its expected value and the true parameter value:

$$\text{Bias}(\hat{\lambda}) = E[\hat{\lambda}] - \lambda$$

From Graph 4, we can observe that:
- The Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) has a constant bias of zero across all sample sizes
- The Method of Moments (MoM) estimator has a negative bias that approaches zero as the sample size increases

For the exponential distribution, the MLE is $\hat{\lambda}_{MLE} = \frac{n}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i} = \frac{1}{\bar{X}}$, where $\bar{X}$ is the sample mean.

**Answer to Question 4**: The MLE appears to be unbiased (zero bias for all sample sizes), while the Method of Moments estimator shows bias for smaller sample sizes. For the exponential distribution, the MLE is $\hat{\lambda} = 1/\bar{X}$, which is theoretically unbiased.

### Step 5: Understanding the Cramér-Rao Bound

![Comprehensive Relationships Between Concepts](../Images/L2_3_Quiz_14/solution_comprehensive.png)

The Cramér-Rao lower bound sets the minimum variance that any unbiased estimator can achieve:

$$\text{Var}(\hat{\lambda}) \geq \frac{1}{I(\lambda)} = \frac{\lambda^2}{n}$$

As the sample size $n$ increases, this bound decreases proportionally to $1/n$. 

At $n = 50$, the Cramér-Rao bound is:

$$\text{Var}(\hat{\lambda}) \geq \frac{(2.0)^2}{50} = \frac{4}{50} = 0.08$$

**Answer to Question 5**: The Cramér-Rao bound decreases inversely with sample size (as $1/n$). At $n = 50$, the bound is approximately 0.08, meaning any unbiased estimator must have a variance of at least 0.08 at this sample size.

### Step 6: Connecting the Concepts

The relationship between the log-likelihood function, score function, and Fisher Information is fundamental to statistical estimation theory:

1. **Log-likelihood function** ($\ell(\lambda)$) measures how well the parameter explains the observed data
2. **Score function** ($S(\lambda)$) is the derivative of the log-likelihood and equals zero at the MLE
3. **Fisher Information** ($I(\lambda)$) is the negative expected value of the second derivative of the log-likelihood and quantifies estimation precision:
   $$I(\lambda) = -E\left[\frac{d^2\ell(\lambda)}{d\lambda^2}\right]$$
4. The **Cramér-Rao bound** (derived from Fisher Information) sets the lower limit on estimator variance:
   $$\text{Var}(\hat{\lambda}) \geq \frac{1}{I(\lambda)}$$
5. **Bias** and **variance** represent the two components of estimation error, with an ideal estimator having low values of both

**Answer to Question 6**: The log-likelihood function measures how well parameters explain the data. Its derivative (the score function) equals zero at the MLE. The Fisher Information, which is the negative expected second derivative of the log-likelihood, measures the amount of information the data provides about the parameter. The inverse of the Fisher Information gives the Cramér-Rao bound, which is the minimum variance possible for any unbiased estimator.

## Visual Explanations

### Log-Likelihood Function
![Log-Likelihood Function](../Images/L2_3_Quiz_14/graph1_log_likelihood.png)

This visualization shows the log-likelihood function $\ell(\lambda)$ across different values of $\lambda$. The peak of this curve occurs at the MLE, approximately at $\lambda = 2.0$. This illustrates how the MLE is the value of $\lambda$ that makes the observed data most probable.

### Score Function
![Score Function](../Images/L2_3_Quiz_14/graph2_score_function.png)

This visualization shows the score function $S(\lambda) = \frac{d\ell(\lambda)}{d\lambda}$ across different values of $\lambda$. The zero-crossing of this function occurs at the MLE, illustrating how the MLE is found by setting the derivative of the log-likelihood to zero.

### Fisher Information
![Fisher Information](../Images/L2_3_Quiz_14/graph3_fisher_information.png)

This visualization shows the Fisher Information $I(\lambda) = \frac{n}{\lambda^2}$ for different values of $\lambda$. The Fisher Information decreases as $\lambda$ increases, illustrating that it's harder to precisely estimate larger values of $\lambda$ from the same sample size.

### Bias Comparison
![Bias Comparison](../Images/L2_3_Quiz_14/graph4_bias_comparison.png)

This visualization compares the bias of the MLE and MoM estimators across different sample sizes. The MLE (blue line) maintains zero bias regardless of sample size, while the MoM estimator (red line) shows bias that decreases with increasing sample size.

### Cramér-Rao Bound
![Cramér-Rao Bound](../Images/L2_3_Quiz_14/graph5_cramer_rao.png)

This visualization shows how the Cramér-Rao lower bound for the variance of an unbiased estimator decreases as sample size increases. The hyperbolic shape illustrates the $1/n$ relationship between variance and sample size.
