2. The variance of a random variable can be negative.
3. For any continuous random variable $X$, $P(X = a) = 0$ for any specific value $a$.
4. If the correlation coefficient between random variables $X$ and $Y$ is 0, then $X$ and $Y$ must be independent.
5. The Law of Large Numbers guarantees that as sample size increases, the sample mean will exactly equal the population mean.

## Understanding the Problem
This problem tests fundamental concepts in probability theory. For each statement, we need to:
- Apply the correct mathematical definition
- Provide clear reasoning or counterexamples
- Determine if the statement is true or false based on probability principles

The key concepts being tested include:
- Independence of events
- Properties of variance
- Continuous probability distributions
- Correlation and its relationship to independence
- The Law of Large Numbers and convergence

## Solution

### Statement 1: Independence and Product Rule
Two events $A$ and $B$ are independent if knowing that one occurred doesn't change the probability of the other occurring. For example, drawing a heart card doesn't affect whether you draw a face card.

For independent events, by definition:
- $P(A|B) = P(A)$ - The occurrence of $B$ doesn't affect the probability of $A$
- $P(B|A) = P(B)$ - The occurrence of $A$ doesn't affect the probability of $B$

Using the definition of conditional probability:
$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$$

Rearranging: 
$$P(A \cap B) = P(A|B) \times P(B)$$

For independent events: 
$$P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B)$$

#### Example 1: Abstract Probability
Consider two independent events with $P(A) = 0.5$ and $P(B) = 0.4$:
$$P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B) = 0.5 \times 0.4 = 0.2$$

#### Example 2: Playing Cards
In a standard 52-card deck:
- $P(\text{Heart}) = \frac{13}{52} = 0.25$ (13 hearts in 52 cards)
- $P(\text{Face Card}) = \frac{12}{52} = 0.23$ (12 face cards: Jacks, Queens, Kings)
- $P(\text{Heart and Face Card}) = \frac{3}{52} = 0.06$ (only 3 cards are both hearts and face cards)
- $P(\text{Heart}) \times P(\text{Face Card}) = 0.25 \times 0.23 = 0.06$

As we can see, $P(\text{Heart and Face Card}) = P(\text{Heart}) \times P(\text{Face Card})$, confirming these events are independent.

#### Additional Notes on Independence
For dependent events, the product rule formula does not hold:
- If $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive: $P(A \cap B) = 0$, but $P(A) \times P(B) \neq 0$
- If $A$ and $B$ are completely dependent (A = B) and $P(A) = P(B) = 0.5$: $P(A \cap B) = 0.5$, but $P(A) \times P(B) = 0.25$

**Therefore, Statement 1 is TRUE.**

### Statement 2: Non-negative Variance
The variance of a random variable $X$ is defined as:
$$\text{Var}(X) = E[(X - \mu)^2]$$

This is the expected value of squared deviations from the mean.

Since we're calculating the expected value of squared terms $(X - \mu)^2$, and squared terms are always non-negative, the variance cannot be negative. It can be zero (when all values are identical) but never negative.

For example, with data having mean $\mu = 5.0387$:
- When $x = 1$: $(x - \mu)^2 = (1 - 5.0387)^2 = 16.3108$
- When $x = 3$: $(x - \mu)^2 = (3 - 5.0387)^2 = 4.1562$
- When $x = 5$: $(x - \mu)^2 = (5 - 5.0387)^2 = 0.0015$
- When $x = 7$: $(x - \mu)^2 = (7 - 5.0387)^2 = 3.8468$
- When $x = 9$: $(x - \mu)^2 = (9 - 5.0387)^2 = 15.6922$

The sample variance is: $3.8316$ (always positive)

**Therefore, Statement 2 is FALSE.**

### Statement 3: Probability at a Point in Continuous Distributions
For a continuous random variable $X$ with probability density function $f(x)$, probabilities are calculated as integrals over intervals:
$$P(a \leq X \leq b) = \int_a^b f(x)dx$$

For a standard normal distribution at $x = 1.0$, we can examine intervals of decreasing width:
- $P(0.5000 < X < 1.5000) = 0.2417303375$
- $P(0.7500 < X < 1.2500) = 0.1209775787$
- $P(0.9000 < X < 1.1000) = 0.0483940644$
- $P(0.9500 < X < 1.0500) = 0.0241970699$
- $P(0.9750 < X < 1.0250) = 0.0120985361$
- $P(0.9950 < X < 1.0050) = 0.0024197072$
- $P(0.9995 < X < 1.0005) = 0.0002419707$
- $P(0.9999 < X < 1.0001) = 0.0000241971$
- $P(0.99999 < X < 1.00001) = 0.0000024197$

As we narrow the interval width around point $a$:
$$P(X = a) = \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} P(a-\varepsilon < X < a+\varepsilon) = 0$$

This is because a single point has "measure zero" in calculus. Even though the density $f(a)$ may be positive, the probability at an exact point is zero.

**Therefore, Statement 3 is TRUE.**

### Statement 4: Correlation and Independence
Correlation measures linear relationships between variables. Zero correlation means no linear relationship, but non-linear dependencies can exist.

Consider $Y = X^2 - 1$, which is completely determined by $X$ (strongly dependent), yet the correlation coefficient can be near zero because the relationship is not linear.

For independence, knowing $X$ should provide no information about $Y$ whatsoever. In our example, knowing $X$ tells us exactly what $Y$ is, proving strong dependence despite possible zero correlation.

Our numerical example shows:
1. $Y$ is a function of $X$: $Y = X^2 - 1$
2. For any value of $X$, we know exactly what $Y$ will be
3. Yet correlation is approximately $0.108457$ (nearly zero)

Additional examples show:
- Linear relationship: correlation $\approx 0.9684$ (Correlated and dependent)
- Quadratic relationship: correlation $\approx 0.0022$ (Uncorrelated but dependent)
- Sinusoidal relationship: correlation $\approx 0.7407$ (Uncorrelated but dependent)
- Independent variables: correlation $\approx 0.0199$ (Uncorrelated and independent)

**Therefore, Statement 4 is FALSE.**

(Zero correlation does not imply independence, though independence does imply zero correlation.)

### Statement 5: Law of Large Numbers and Exactness
The Law of Large Numbers (LLN) states that as sample size increases, the sample mean converges in probability to the population mean.

Mathematical formulation: For any $\varepsilon > 0$, 
$$P(|\bar{X}_n - \mu| > \varepsilon) \to 0 \text{ as } n \to \infty$$

Even with large samples (e.g., $n = 10,000$), we still observe small differences between the sample means and population mean. The LLN guarantees that this difference can be made arbitrarily small with high probability, but not that it will exactly equal zero for any finite sample size.

Example with population mean $\mu = 50$ and population standard deviation $\sigma = 10$:

**Trial 1:**
- $n = 10$: $\bar{X}_n = 54.4806$, $|\bar{X}_n - \mu| = 4.4806$
- $n = 289$: $\bar{X}_n = 51.0832$, $|\bar{X}_n - \mu| = 1.0832$
- $n = 10000$: $\bar{X}_n = 50.0284$, $|\bar{X}_n - \mu| = 0.0284$

**Trial 2:**
- $n = 10$: $\bar{X}_n = 55.9893$, $|\bar{X}_n - \mu| = 5.9893$
- $n = 289$: $\bar{X}_n = 50.3494$, $|\bar{X}_n - \mu| = 0.3494$
- $n = 10000$: $\bar{X}_n = 49.9600$, $|\bar{X}_n - \mu| = 0.0400$

**Trial 3:**
- $n = 10$: $\bar{X}_n = 55.7566$, $|\bar{X}_n - \mu| = 5.7566$
- $n = 289$: $\bar{X}_n = 50.2071$, $|\bar{X}_n - \mu| = 0.2071$
- $n = 10000$: $\bar{X}_n = 50.0504$, $|\bar{X}_n - \mu| = 0.0504$

Even with very large samples ($n = 10,000$), we observe:
- Average absolute error across 50 experiments: $0.081248$
- Maximum absolute error: $0.233939$
- Minimum absolute error: $0.001111$

The sample mean approaches the population mean but does not equal it exactly.

**Therefore, Statement 5 is FALSE.**

## Visual Explanations

### Independent Events - Venn Diagram
![Independence: Venn Diagram](../Images/L2_1_Quiz_20/statement1_venn.png)

This simple Venn diagram illustrates two independent events $A$ and $B$ with their intersection. For events with $P(A) = 0.5$ and $P(B) = 0.4$, the intersection has probability $P(A\cap B) = 0.2$, which equals $P(A) \times P(B)$.

### Independent Events - Probability Tree
![Independence: Probability Tree](../Images/L2_1_Quiz_20/statement1_tree.png)

This probability tree shows how events branch, with probabilities at each step. Notice that $P(B) = 0.4$ remains the same whether $A$ occurred or not - this is the key property of independence. The probability of following the $A\to B$ path equals $P(A) \times P(B) = 0.5 \times 0.4 = 0.2$.

### Independent Events - Card Example
![Independence: Card Example](../Images/L2_1_Quiz_20/statement1_cards.png)

This concrete example uses playing cards to demonstrate independence. The red cells represent hearts, blue cells represent face cards, and purple cells represent cards that are both hearts and face cards.

Card Probabilities:
- $P(\text{Heart}) = \frac{13}{52} = 0.25$
- $P(\text{Face Card}) = \frac{12}{52} = 0.23$
- $P(\text{Heart and Face}) = \frac{3}{52} = 0.06$
- $P(\text{Heart}) \times P(\text{Face}) = 0.25 \times 0.23 = 0.06$

Therefore: $P(\text{Heart} \cap \text{Face}) = P(\text{Heart}) \times P(\text{Face})$

This confirms that the suit (hearts vs. non-hearts) and rank (face vs. non-face) are independent events in a standard deck of cards.

### Non-negative Variance
![Non-negative Variance](../Images/L2_1_Quiz_20/statement2_squared_deviations.png)

Visualization of squared deviations from the mean. Since variance is the expected value of these squared deviations, and squared values are always non-negative, variance cannot be negative.

![Squared Values](../Images/L2_1_Quiz_20/statement2_squared_function.png)

This graph shows that squared values are always non-negative for any input value, which is why variance can never be negative.

![Variance Comparison](../Images/L2_1_Quiz_20/statement2_variance_comparison.png)

Comparison of distributions with different variances, illustrating how variance represents the spread of data.

### Continuous Random Variables
![Normal PDF](../Images/L2_1_Quiz_20/statement3_normal_pdf.png)

This visualization shows the probability density function of a standard normal distribution. For continuous distributions, the probability at any exact point is zero.

![Shrinking Intervals](../Images/L2_1_Quiz_20/statement3_shrinking_intervals.png)

As we shrink the interval width around a specific point, the probability approaches zero, demonstrating that $P(X = a) = 0$ for continuous random variables.

![Discrete vs Continuous](../Images/L2_1_Quiz_20/statement3_discrete_vs_continuous.png)

Comparison between discrete and continuous probability distributions. In discrete distributions, points can have positive probability, while in continuous distributions, individual points have zero probability.

### Correlation vs Independence
![Dependent but Uncorrelated](../Images/L2_1_Quiz_20/statement4_dependent_uncorrelated.png)

This scatter plot shows $Y = X^2 - 1$, where $Y$ is completely determined by $X$ (strongly dependent), yet the correlation coefficient is near zero because the relationship is not linear.

![Truly Independent](../Images/L2_1_Quiz_20/statement4_truly_independent.png)

This scatter plot shows truly independent variables. They appear as a random cloud with no discernible pattern.

![Correlation vs Independence](../Images/L2_1_Quiz_20/statement4_correlation_vs_independence.png)

Four scenarios comparing correlation and independence: linear relationship (correlated, dependent), quadratic relationship (uncorrelated but dependent), sinusoidal relationship (partially correlated, dependent), and no relationship (uncorrelated, independent).

### Law of Large Numbers
![Sample Paths](../Images/L2_1_Quiz_20/statement5_sample_paths.png)

Multiple sample paths showing convergence of sample means to the population mean as sample size increases. The gray band represents the 95% confidence interval, which narrows with increasing sample size.

![Mean Distributions](../Images/L2_1_Quiz_20/statement5_mean_distributions.png)

Distribution of sample means for different sample sizes. As sample size increases, the distribution becomes narrower and centered more precisely on the population mean.

![Absolute Errors](../Images/L2_1_Quiz_20/statement5_absolute_errors.png)

Absolute errors between sample means and the population mean for large sample sizes. Even with very large samples, some error typically remains, contradicting the claim that the sample mean will exactly equal the population mean.

## Key Insights

### Independence and Probability
- Independence means the occurrence of one event provides no information about the occurrence of another
- For independent events, $P(A\cap B) = P(A) \times P(B)$ - this is both a definition and a test for independence
- Independence allows us to simplify joint probability calculations
- In a probability tree, independence means the branching probabilities don't depend on the path taken
- Real-world examples include: drawing cards (suit vs. rank), rolling multiple dice, or separate coin flips

### Properties of Variance
- Variance is a measure of dispersion that quantifies how far values are spread from their mean
- Being defined as the expected value of squared deviations, variance must be non-negative
- A variance of zero indicates no variability (constant random variable)
- Variance is fundamental to understanding uncertainty in data and models

### Continuous Probability Distributions
- Unlike discrete distributions, continuous distributions assign zero probability to individual points
- Probabilities are calculated as areas under the density curve over intervals
- This principle has important implications for statistical inference with continuous data
- It explains why we work with intervals and densities rather than exact point probabilities

### Correlation vs Independence
- Correlation only measures linear relationships between variables
- Zero correlation doesn't imply independence, but independence does imply zero correlation
- Non-linear dependencies can exist even when correlation is zero
- This distinction is crucial when analyzing relationships in data, especially in complex systems

### Law of Large Numbers
- The LLN guarantees that sample means converge to the population mean in probability
- This convergence means the probability of any non-zero deviation becomes arbitrarily small
- However, for any finite sample size, some difference between sample and population means typically remains
- The LLN provides the theoretical foundation for statistical sampling and estimation
