# Question 35: Covariance Concepts True/False

## Problem Statement
Evaluate whether each of the following statements is TRUE or FALSE. Justify your answer with a brief explanation.

## Task
1. For a multivariate normal distribution, a diagonal covariance matrix implies that the variables are uncorrelated, resulting in probability density contours that are axis-aligned ellipses (or circles if variances are equal).
2. Covariance measures the tendency of two random variables to vary together; a positive value indicates they tend to increase or decrease together, while a negative value indicates one tends to increase as the other decreases.
3. All valid covariance matrices must be positive semi-definite, meaning $\text{Var}(a^T X) = a^T \Sigma a \ge 0$ for any vector $a$.
4. A covariance matrix is strictly positive definite if and only if all its eigenvalues are strictly positive; this condition guarantees the matrix is invertible.
5. Covariance only quantifies the strength and direction of the *linear* relationship between two random variables.
6. Zero covariance ($\text{Cov}(X,Y) = 0$) guarantees that the random variables X and Y are statistically independent.
7. The covariance between X and Y can be calculated using the formula $\text{Cov}(X,Y) = \mathbb{E}[(X - \mathbb{E}[X])(Y - \mathbb{E}[Y])] = \mathbb{E}[XY] - \mathbb{E}[X]\mathbb{E}[Y]$.
8. The covariance of a random variable X with itself, $\text{Cov}(X,X)$, is equal to its variance, $\text{Var}(X)$.
9. In a bivariate normal distribution, negative correlation corresponds to probability density contours being tilted primarily along the line $y = -x$.
10. The principal axes of the probability density contours for a multivariate normal distribution align with the eigenvectors of its covariance matrix.
11. Contour lines on a probability density plot connect points having the same probability density value.
12. For any $n \times n$ covariance matrix with eigenvalues $\lambda_1 \geq \lambda_2 \geq \cdots \geq \lambda_n$, the volume of the ellipsoid representing the region within one standard deviation is directly proportional to $\sum_{i=1}^{n} \lambda_i$ rather than $\prod_{i=1}^{n} \lambda_i$.
13. In a multivariate normal distribution, the angle of rotation of probability density contours in a 2D plane is always given by $\theta = \frac{1}{2}\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{2\sigma_{xy}}{\sigma_x^2-\sigma_y^2}\right)$, regardless of whether $\sigma_x^2 = \sigma_y^2$.

## Solution

### Statement 1: Diagonal Covariance Matrix and Axis-Aligned Contours

#### Analysis
For a multivariate normal distribution, the covariance matrix determines the shape, orientation, and size of the probability density contours. When the covariance matrix is diagonal (all off-diagonal elements are zero), this means the variables are uncorrelated.

Let's visualize the contours for different types of covariance matrices:

![Diagonal Covariance](../Images/L2_1_35/1_diagonal_covariance.png)

In this figure:
- The left plot shows a diagonal covariance matrix with equal variances, resulting in circular contours
- The middle plot shows a diagonal covariance matrix with unequal variances, resulting in axis-aligned elliptical contours
- The right plot shows a non-diagonal covariance matrix, resulting in tilted elliptical contours

A diagonal covariance matrix means that the variables are uncorrelated, which geometrically results in probability density contours that are aligned with the coordinate axes. If the diagonal elements are equal, these contours form circles; otherwise, they form axis-aligned ellipses with the semi-major and semi-minor axes proportional to the square roots of the variances.

#### Verdict
Statement 1 is **TRUE**. A diagonal covariance matrix implies uncorrelated variables and results in axis-aligned elliptical contours (or circular contours if the diagonal elements are equal).

### Statement 2: Covariance and Variable Relationships

#### Analysis
Covariance measures how two random variables change together. Let's examine what positive, negative, and zero covariance values tell us:

![Positive and Negative Covariance](../Images/L2_1_35/2_positive_negative_covariance.png)

As shown in the figure:
- Positive covariance (left plot): The variables tend to increase or decrease together
- Negative covariance (middle plot): When one variable increases, the other tends to decrease
- Zero covariance (right plot): No linear relationship between the variables

The magnitude of the covariance indicates the strength of the linear relationship, but it is scale-dependent. For a standardized measure, correlation coefficient (which ranges from -1 to 1) is often preferred.

#### Verdict
Statement 2 is **TRUE**. Covariance measures the tendency of variables to vary together, with the sign indicating the direction of the relationship.

### Statement 3: Positive Semi-Definiteness of Covariance Matrices

#### Analysis
For a matrix to be a valid covariance matrix, it must be positive semi-definite. This means that for any vector $a$, the quadratic form $a^T \Sigma a$ must be non-negative.

This property ensures that variances are always non-negative. Consider that for any linear combination of random variables $Y = a^T X$, the variance of Y is:

$$Var(Y) = Var(a^T X) = a^T \Sigma a$$

If $a^T \Sigma a$ could be negative for some $a$, this would imply a negative variance, which is impossible.

Let's examine different matrices to understand this property:

![Positive Semi-Definite Matrices](../Images/L2_1_35/3_positive_semi_definite.png)

The figure shows:
- Left: A positive definite matrix where $a^T \Sigma a > 0$ for all non-zero $a$
- Middle: A positive semi-definite matrix where $a^T \Sigma a \geq 0$ for all $a$
- Right: An indefinite matrix that cannot be a valid covariance matrix because $a^T \Sigma a < 0$ for some $a$

A key characteristic of positive semi-definite matrices is that all their eigenvalues are non-negative. Indefinite matrices, with some negative eigenvalues, cannot be valid covariance matrices.

#### Verdict
Statement 3 is **TRUE**. All valid covariance matrices must be positive semi-definite to ensure non-negative variances for all linear combinations of random variables.

### Statement 4: Positive Definiteness and Invertibility

#### Analysis
A covariance matrix is strictly positive definite if and only if all its eigenvalues are strictly positive. This condition is equivalent to requiring that $a^T \Sigma a > 0$ for all non-zero vectors $a$.

Positive definiteness guarantees invertibility because a matrix is invertible if and only if its determinant is non-zero. Since the determinant of a matrix equals the product of its eigenvalues, having all positive eigenvalues ensures a non-zero determinant.

![Eigenvalues and Positive Definiteness](../Images/L2_1_35/4_eigenvalues_definiteness.png)

The figure illustrates:
- Left: A positive definite matrix with all eigenvalues strictly positive, resulting in an invertible matrix
- Middle: A positive semi-definite matrix with some zero eigenvalues, which is not invertible
- Right: A visualization of eigenvalue magnitudes and their relationship to invertibility

Invertibility is crucial in many statistical applications, such as calculating the probability density function of a multivariate normal distribution, which requires the inverse of the covariance matrix.

#### Verdict
Statement 4 is **TRUE**. A covariance matrix is strictly positive definite if and only if all its eigenvalues are strictly positive, which guarantees the matrix is invertible.

### Statement 5: Covariance and Linear Relationships

#### Analysis
Covariance only captures linear relationships between random variables. For non-linear relationships, covariance may be low or even zero despite strong dependence between variables.

![Linear Relationship and Covariance](../Images/L2_1_35/5_linear_relationship_covariance.png)

This figure demonstrates:
- Top left: A linear relationship with strong covariance
- Top right: A non-linear (quadratic) relationship with near-zero covariance
- Bottom: Visualization of how covariance is computed as the average product of centered variables, with positive and negative contributions from different quadrants

Covariance measures the average product of centered variables: $E[(X-E[X])(Y-E[Y])]$. Positive contributions come from quadrants where both variables are above or below their means, while negative contributions come from quadrants where one variable is above while the other is below its mean.

For the quadratic relationship shown, despite a clear deterministic relationship between the variables, the covariance is close to zero because the positive and negative contributions cancel out.

#### Verdict
Statement 5 is **TRUE**. Covariance only quantifies the strength and direction of linear relationships between random variables and may miss non-linear dependencies.

### Statement 6: Zero Covariance and Independence

#### Analysis
Zero covariance between variables X and Y indicates there is no linear relationship between them. However, this does not necessarily mean the variables are independent.

![Zero Covariance vs. Independence](../Images/L2_1_35/6_zero_covariance_vs_independence.png)

The figure shows:
- Left: Truly independent variables with zero covariance
- Middle: Dependent variables with zero covariance (quadratic relationship)
- Right: Difference between joint distribution and product of marginals (should be zero everywhere for independence)

Independence implies zero covariance, but the converse is not true in general. Variables can have zero covariance yet be strongly dependent through non-linear relationships.

For independent variables, the joint probability distribution equals the product of the marginal distributions: $P(X,Y) = P(X)P(Y)$. For dependent variables with zero covariance, the joint distribution differs from the product of marginals.

However, for the special case of multivariate normal distributions, zero covariance does imply independence.

#### Verdict
Statement 6 is **FALSE**. Zero covariance does not generally guarantee that random variables are statistically independent. It only indicates the absence of a linear relationship.

### Statement 7: Covariance Formula

#### Analysis
The covariance between random variables X and Y can be expressed in two equivalent forms:

1. $Cov(X,Y) = E[(X - E[X])(Y - E[Y])]$
2. $Cov(X,Y) = E[XY] - E[X]E[Y]$

![Covariance Formula](../Images/L2_1_35/7_covariance_formula.png)

The figure demonstrates the equivalence of these formulations:
- Left: Visualization of bivariate data and computed covariance using both methods
- Right: Scatter plot showing the perfect equivalence between the two formulations

The mathematical proof of this equivalence is straightforward:
$$\begin{align}
E[(X - E[X])(Y - E[Y])] &= E[XY - Y\cdot E[X] - X \cdot E[Y] + E[X]E[Y]]\\
&= E[XY] - E[Y \cdot E[X]] - E[X \cdot E[Y]] + E[X]E[Y]\\
&= E[XY] - E[Y] \cdot E[X] - E[X] \cdot E[Y] + E[X]E[Y]\\
&= E[XY] - E[X]E[Y]
\end{align}$$

#### Verdict
Statement 7 is **TRUE**. The covariance between X and Y can be calculated using either formula: $Cov(X,Y) = E[(X - E[X])(Y - E[Y])] = E[XY] - E[X]E[Y]$.

### Statement 8: Self-Covariance and Variance

#### Analysis
When calculating the covariance of a random variable with itself, we get the variance:

$$Cov(X,X) = E[(X-E[X])(X-E[X])] = E[(X-E[X])^2] = Var(X)$$

This is clearly demonstrated in our numerical experiments, where:
- $Cov(X,X) = 0.4915$
- $Var(X) = 0.4915$

The variance is simply a special case of covariance when the two variables are identical.

#### Verdict
Statement 8 is **TRUE**. The covariance of a random variable with itself equals its variance.

### Statement 9: Negative Correlation and Contour Orientation

#### Analysis
In a bivariate normal distribution, the correlation coefficient determines the orientation of the probability density contours.

![Negative Correlation and Principal Axes](../Images/L2_1_35/8_negative_correlation_principal_axes.png)

As shown in the figure:
- Left column: Negative correlation results in contours tilted along the line $y = -x$
- Middle column: Zero correlation results in axis-aligned contours
- Right column: Positive correlation results in contours tilted along the line $y = x$

With negative correlation, when one variable increases, the other tends to decrease, leading to contours that are elongated in the direction from top-left to bottom-right (along $y = -x$).

#### Verdict
Statement 9 is **TRUE**. In a bivariate normal distribution, negative correlation corresponds to probability density contours being tilted primarily along the line $y = -x$.

### Statement 10: Principal Axes and Eigenvectors

#### Analysis
The principal axes of the probability density contours for a multivariate normal distribution align with the eigenvectors of its covariance matrix.

As shown in the previous figure, the arrows in the bottom row represent the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix, which align perfectly with the major and minor axes of the elliptical contours.

Eigenvectors point in the directions of maximum and minimum variance, and eigenvalues represent the amount of variance in those directions. The eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue points in the direction of maximum variance, which is the major axis of the elliptical contours.

#### Verdict
Statement 10 is **TRUE**. The principal axes of the probability density contours for a multivariate normal distribution align with the eigenvectors of its covariance matrix.

### Statement 11: Contour Lines and Probability Density

#### Analysis
Contour lines on a probability density plot connect points that have the same probability density value.

![Contour Lines](../Images/L2_1_35/9_contour_lines.png)

The figure demonstrates:
- Left: 3D surface of a probability density function
- Right: Contour plot showing lines of equal probability density

These contours can be thought of as horizontal "slices" through the 3D probability density surface at constant heights. Each contour represents a set of points with equal probability density.

For a multivariate normal distribution, these contours form ellipses (or circles in special cases).

#### Verdict
Statement 11 is **TRUE**. Contour lines on a probability density plot connect points having the same probability density value.

### Statement 12: Volume of Standard Deviation Ellipsoid

#### Analysis
For an $n \times n$ covariance matrix $\Sigma$ with eigenvalues $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \ldots, \lambda_n$, the volume of the ellipsoid representing the region within one standard deviation is proportional to the square root of the determinant of the covariance matrix:

$$\text{Volume} \propto \sqrt{\det(\Sigma)} = \sqrt{\prod_{i=1}^{n} \lambda_i}$$

This is because the principal semi-axes of the ellipsoid are proportional to the square roots of the eigenvalues of $\Sigma$. The volume of an ellipsoid with semi-axes $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ is proportional to $\prod_{i=1}^{n} a_i$, which, in this case, is proportional to $\prod_{i=1}^{n} \sqrt{\lambda_i} = \sqrt{\prod_{i=1}^{n} \lambda_i}$.

The statement incorrectly suggests that the volume is proportional to the sum of eigenvalues, $\sum_{i=1}^{n} \lambda_i$, which is the trace of the covariance matrix. The trace represents the total variance across all dimensions, but does not determine the volume of the standard deviation ellipsoid.

![Ellipsoid Volume](../Images/L2_1_35/10_ellipsoid_volume.png)

The figure illustrates how the volume of the ellipsoid is affected by the product, not the sum, of eigenvalues. Two ellipsoids with the same sum of eigenvalues but different products have different volumes.

#### Verdict
Statement 12 is **FALSE**. The volume of the ellipsoid representing the region within one standard deviation is proportional to the square root of the product of eigenvalues (determinant), not the sum of eigenvalues (trace).

### Statement 13: Angle of Rotation of Probability Density Contours

#### Analysis
For a bivariate normal distribution with covariance matrix 
$$\Sigma = \begin{bmatrix} \sigma_x^2 & \sigma_{xy} \\ \sigma_{xy} & \sigma_y^2 \end{bmatrix}$$

the angle of rotation of the probability density contours is given by:

$$\theta = \frac{1}{2}\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{2\sigma_{xy}}{\sigma_x^2-\sigma_y^2}\right)$$

However, this formula is only valid when $\sigma_x^2 \neq \sigma_y^2$. When $\sigma_x^2 = \sigma_y^2$ (i.e., the variances are equal), the formula becomes undefined due to division by zero, and the orientation of the ellipse depends solely on the sign of $\sigma_{xy}$:

- If $\sigma_{xy} > 0$, the ellipse is oriented at 45° (along $y = x$)
- If $\sigma_{xy} < 0$, the ellipse is oriented at 135° (along $y = -x$)
- If $\sigma_{xy} = 0$, there is no preferred orientation (the contours form circles)

![Rotation Angles](../Images/L2_1_35/11_rotation_angles.png)

The figure shows how the orientation of probability contours changes with different covariance structures.

#### Verdict
Statement 13 is **FALSE**. The given formula for the angle of rotation is not valid when $\sigma_x^2 = \sigma_y^2$. In this special case, the orientation is determined only by the sign of $\sigma_{xy}$.

## Summary
