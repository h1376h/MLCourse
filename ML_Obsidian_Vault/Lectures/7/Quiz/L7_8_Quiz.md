# Topic 7.8: Advanced Ensemble Topics and Applications Quiz

## Overview
This quiz tests your understanding of advanced ensemble topics, including dynamic ensembles, online learning, ensemble pruning, and real-world applications.

## Question 1

### Problem Statement
Dynamic ensembles adapt their structure based on data characteristics.

#### Task
1. What is the main advantage of dynamic ensembles?
2. How do dynamic ensembles differ from static ensembles?
3. What triggers changes in dynamic ensemble structure?
4. When would you prefer a dynamic ensemble over a static one?

**Answer**:
1. Main advantage: can adapt to changing data patterns and maintain performance over time
2. Dynamic ensembles change their composition during operation, static ensembles remain fixed
3. Changes are triggered by: performance degradation, concept drift, new data arrival, or changing data distribution
4. Prefer dynamic ensembles when: data patterns change over time, online learning is required, or maintaining performance is critical

## Question 2

### Problem Statement
Online ensemble learning updates models incrementally.

#### Task
1. What is the main benefit of online ensemble learning?
2. How does online learning handle concept drift?
3. What are the challenges of online ensemble learning?
4. When is online learning preferred over batch learning?

**Answer**:
1. Main benefit: can adapt to new data without retraining the entire ensemble
2. Online learning handles concept drift by updating model weights or adding/removing models based on recent performance
3. Challenges: accumulating errors, maintaining stability, computational overhead, memory management
4. Online learning is preferred when: data arrives continuously, real-time adaptation is needed, or storage is limited

## Question 3

### Problem Statement
Ensemble pruning removes redundant or poor-performing models.

#### Task
1. What is the purpose of ensemble pruning?
2. What criteria can be used for pruning decisions?
3. How does pruning affect ensemble performance?
4. What is the tradeoff between ensemble size and pruning?

**Answer**:
1. Purpose: reduce computational cost, improve generalization, remove redundant models
2. Pruning criteria: individual model performance, diversity contribution, redundancy with other models
3. Pruning can improve performance by removing poor models but may reduce ensemble robustness
4. Tradeoff: larger ensembles provide more diversity but higher computational cost, pruning balances this

## Question 4

### Problem Statement
Ensemble diversity is crucial for performance.

#### Task
1. What are three ways to measure ensemble diversity?
2. How does diversity relate to ensemble performance?
3. What is the optimal level of diversity?
4. How can you increase diversity in an existing ensemble?

**Answer**:
1. Three ways: disagreement rate, correlation between predictions, entropy of ensemble predictions
2. Relationship: moderate diversity improves performance, too much diversity reduces individual model quality
3. Optimal diversity: enough to provide complementary predictions but not so much that individual models become poor
4. Increase diversity by: adding different algorithms, using different feature subsets, varying hyperparameters, or using different training data

## Question 5

### Problem Statement
Real-world applications of ensemble methods have specific requirements.

#### Task
1. What are the key considerations for medical diagnosis ensembles?
2. How do financial prediction ensembles differ from other applications?
3. What challenges exist in deploying ensemble models in production?
4. How do you balance interpretability and performance in real-world applications?

**Answer**:
1. Medical diagnosis: interpretability, confidence estimates, regulatory compliance, validation with experts
2. Financial prediction: real-time updates, concept drift handling, risk management, interpretability for compliance
3. Production challenges: model versioning, A/B testing, monitoring performance, handling data drift
4. Balance by: using simpler ensembles when interpretability is crucial, complex ensembles when performance is paramount, or hybrid approaches
