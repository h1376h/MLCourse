## Understanding the Problem
Comprehensive evaluation of AdaBoost requires systematic testing across diverse scenarios while maintaining statistical rigor. The challenge lies in balancing thoroughness with computational feasibility, ensuring that results are both meaningful and actionable. A well-designed evaluation framework provides insights into when and how AdaBoost performs best, guiding practical implementation decisions.

## Solution

We'll design a comprehensive evaluation framework that systematically tests AdaBoost across multiple dimensions while respecting computational constraints.

### Step 1: Comprehensive Dataset Design

**Synthetic Datasets:**

**Balanced Binary Classification:**
- **Samples**: 1,000, **Features**: 20, **Classes**: 2
- **Class Balance**: [50%, 50%]
- **Purpose**: Baseline performance assessment
- **Characteristics**: Moderate difficulty, well-separated classes

**Imbalanced Binary Classification:**
- **Samples**: 1,000, **Features**: 20, **Classes**: 2
- **Class Balance**: [89.8%, 10.2%]
- **Purpose**: Test performance on imbalanced data
- **Characteristics**: Realistic class imbalance scenario

**Multi-class Classification:**
- **Samples**: 1,000, **Features**: 20, **Classes**: 5
- **Class Balance**: [19.8%, 20.1%, 20.2%, 20.1%, 19.8%]
- **Purpose**: Evaluate multi-class extension performance
- **Characteristics**: Balanced multi-class problem

**High-Dimensional, Low-Sample:**
- **Samples**: 200, **Features**: 100, **Classes**: 2
- **Class Balance**: [50%, 50%]
- **Purpose**: Test curse of dimensionality handling
- **Characteristics**: Challenging overfitting scenario

**Noisy Dataset:**
- **Samples**: 1,000, **Features**: 20, **Classes**: 2
- **Class Balance**: [48.7%, 51.3%]
- **Purpose**: Evaluate robustness to noise
- **Characteristics**: 10% label noise, low separability

**Real-World Datasets:**

**Breast Cancer (Medical):**
- **Samples**: 569, **Features**: 30, **Classes**: 2
- **Class Balance**: [37.3%, 62.7%]
- **Purpose**: Medical diagnosis performance

**Wine Classification (Chemical):**
- **Samples**: 178, **Features**: 13, **Classes**: 3
- **Class Balance**: [33.1%, 39.9%, 27.0%]
- **Purpose**: Multi-class real-world performance

**Mathematical Foundation for Dataset Design:**

The dataset design follows these principles:

1. **Representativeness**: Each dataset represents a different learning scenario
2. **Scalability**: Datasets range from small (178 samples) to moderate (1,000 samples)
3. **Dimensionality**: Features range from 13 to 100 to test different complexity levels
4. **Class Balance**: From perfectly balanced (50%-50%) to highly imbalanced (90%-10%)
5. **Noise Level**: Including datasets with label noise to test robustness

For synthetic datasets, we use the following mathematical formulation:
- **Balanced**: $P(y=0) = P(y=1) = 0.5$
- **Imbalanced**: $P(y=0) = 0.9, P(y=1) = 0.1$
- **Multi-class**: $P(y=i) \approx 0.2$ for $i \in \{0,1,2,3,4\}$
- **Noisy**: $P(\text{correct label}) = 0.9, P(\text{incorrect label}) = 0.1$

### Step 2: Weak Learner Configuration Matrix

**Decision Stump:**
- **Description**: Single-level decision tree
- **Complexity**: Very Low
- **Interpretability**: Very High
- **Use Case**: Baseline, interpretable models

**Shallow Tree (Depth 2):**
- **Description**: Two-level decision tree
- **Complexity**: Low
- **Interpretability**: High
- **Use Case**: Slightly more complex patterns

**Shallow Tree (Depth 3):**
- **Description**: Three-level decision tree
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Interpretability**: Medium
- **Use Case**: Complex feature interactions

**Limited Features Tree:**
- **Description**: Shallow tree with feature subsampling
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Interpretability**: Medium
- **Use Case**: High-dimensional data

**Min Samples Split Tree:**
- **Description**: Shallow tree with minimum samples constraint
- **Complexity**: Low
- **Interpretability**: High
- **Use Case**: Overfitting prevention

**Mathematical Analysis of Weak Learner Complexity:**

The complexity of weak learners can be quantified as follows:

1. **Decision Stump**: 
   - Number of possible splits: $d$ (where $d$ is the number of features)
   - Maximum number of leaf nodes: 2
   - Computational complexity: $O(nd)$ where $n$ is sample size

2. **Shallow Tree (Depth k)**:
   - Maximum number of leaf nodes: $2^k$
   - Maximum number of splits: $2^k - 1$
   - Computational complexity: $O(n \cdot d \cdot 2^k)$

3. **Feature Subsampling**:
   - If using $\sqrt{d}$ features: complexity becomes $O(n \cdot \sqrt{d} \cdot 2^k)$
   - This reduces overfitting while maintaining interpretability

### Step 3: Ensemble Size Systematic Testing

**Ensemble Size Range**: [10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 500]

**Testing Objectives:**
- **Optimal Size Identification**: Find best ensemble size per dataset
- **Overfitting Analysis**: Detect when more learners hurt performance
- **Computational Cost**: Measure training time vs performance trade-offs
- **Diminishing Returns**: Identify point where improvements plateau

**Performance Tracking:**
- **Training Error**: Monitor convergence behavior
- **Validation Error**: Detect overfitting onset
- **Training Time**: Measure computational cost
- **Memory Usage**: Track resource requirements

**Mathematical Framework for Ensemble Size Analysis:**

The relationship between ensemble size and performance can be modeled as:

$$E_{\text{ensemble}} = E_{\text{base}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{M}}$$

where:
- $E_{\text{ensemble}}$ is the ensemble error
- $E_{\text{base}}$ is the base learner error
- $M$ is the ensemble size

This suggests that error decreases as $\frac{1}{\sqrt{M}}$, meaning:
- Initial improvements are rapid (small $M$ values)
- Diminishing returns set in around $M = 100$
- Beyond $M = 500$, improvements become negligible

**Convergence Analysis:**

For AdaBoost specifically, the training error converges exponentially:
$$E_{\text{train}}^{(t)} \leq \prod_{i=1}^{t} \sqrt{2\epsilon_i(1-\epsilon_i)}$$

where $\epsilon_i$ is the error of the $i$-th weak learner. This suggests that:
- Early iterations provide significant improvements
- Later iterations offer diminishing returns
- Optimal ensemble size depends on the quality of weak learners

### Step 4: Statistical Significance Testing

**Experimental Design:**
- **Cross-Validation**: 5-fold stratified CV
- **Repetitions**: Multiple runs for statistical power
- **Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

**Statistical Tests Applied:**

**Paired t-test:**
- **Purpose**: Compare two configurations on same dataset
- **Assumptions**: Normal distribution of differences
- **Output**: t-statistic, p-value, effect size (Cohen's d)

**Significance Levels:**
- **p < 0.001**: *** (highly significant)
- **p < 0.01**: ** (very significant)
- **p < 0.05**: * (significant)
- **p ≥ 0.05**: ns (not significant)

**Effect Size Interpretation:**
- **Cohen's d < 0.2**: Small effect
- **0.2 ≤ Cohen's d < 0.8**: Medium effect
- **Cohen's d ≥ 0.8**: Large effect

**Mathematical Foundation for Statistical Testing:**

1. **Paired t-test Statistic**:
   $$t = \frac{\bar{d}}{s_d/\sqrt{n}}$$
   where:
   - $\bar{d}$ is the mean difference between configurations
   - $s_d$ is the standard deviation of differences
   - $n$ is the number of cross-validation folds

2. **Effect Size (Cohen's d)**:
   $$d = \frac{\bar{d}}{s_{\text{pooled}}}$$
   where $s_{\text{pooled}}$ is the pooled standard deviation

3. **Statistical Power**:
   The power of the test depends on:
   - Sample size (number of CV folds)
   - Effect size
   - Significance level
   - For 5-fold CV with medium effect size, power ≈ 0.6-0.8

**Results Summary:**
- **18 configuration combinations** evaluated
- **9 statistical tests** performed
- **Significant differences found** in 6/9 comparisons
- **Effect sizes** ranging from small to large

### Step 5: Computational Constraint Optimization

**Standard Experiment (3.0 hours, Recommended):**
- **Datasets**: 5
- **Weak Learners**: 2
- **Ensemble Sizes**: 3

- **Datasets**: 7
- **Weak Learners**: 5
- **Ensemble Sizes**: 6
- **CV Folds**: 10
- **Total Combinations**: 210
- **Feasible**: No

**Mathematical Model for Computational Cost:**

The total computational time can be modeled as:

$$T_{\text{total}} = T_{\text{setup}} + T_{\text{training}} + T_{\text{evaluation}}$$

where:

1. **Setup Time**:
   $$T_{\text{setup}} = n_d \cdot (T_{\text{load}} + T_{\text{preprocess}})$$
   - $n_d$ = number of datasets
   - $T_{\text{load}}$ = time to load dataset
   - $T_{\text{preprocess}}$ = time to preprocess dataset

2. **Training Time**:
   $$T_{\text{training}} = n_d \cdot n_w \cdot n_e \cdot n_{cv} \cdot T_{\text{base}}$$
   - $n_w$ = number of weak learner configurations
   - $n_e$ = number of ensemble sizes
   - $n_{cv}$ = number of cross-validation folds
   - $T_{\text{base}}$ = base training time per configuration

3. **Evaluation Time**:
   $$T_{\text{evaluation}} = T_{\text{statistical}} + T_{\text{visualization}}$$

**Optimization Strategy:**

Given the constraint $T_{\text{total}} \leq 24 \text{ hours}$, we can:

1. **Maximize Information Gain**: Choose configurations that provide the most insights
2. **Balance Coverage**: Ensure representation across different problem types
3. **Prioritize Critical Tests**: Focus on configurations most likely to show differences
