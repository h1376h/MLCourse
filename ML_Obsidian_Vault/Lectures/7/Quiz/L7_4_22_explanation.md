# Question 22: AdaBoost for Computer Vision Tasks

## Problem Statement
Design an AdaBoost ensemble for a computer vision task.

- Binary classification: Image contains/doesn't contain object
- 10,000 training images
- Features: HOG, SIFT, color histograms
- Need real-time performance

### Task
1. What type of weak learners would be appropriate for image features?
2. How would you handle the high-dimensional feature space?
3. What preprocessing steps would you recommend?
4. How would you ensure real-time performance?
5. If you need to classify 100 images per second, what's your maximum ensemble size?

## Understanding the Problem
Computer vision tasks present unique challenges for AdaBoost systems: extremely high-dimensional feature spaces (often thousands of features), computational constraints for real-time processing, and the need to extract meaningful patterns from complex visual data. The key is balancing feature expressiveness with computational efficiency while maintaining robust performance across diverse visual conditions.

- **Benefits**: Handles curse of dimensionality, noise reduction
- **Results**: 
  - 100 components: 34.4% variance explained
  - 500 components: 54.1% variance explained
  - 1000 components: 66.9% variance explained

**Outlier Removal (Priority: 6/10):**
