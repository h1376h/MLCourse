# Question 20: AdaBoost for Recommendation Systems

## Problem Statement
Design an AdaBoost ensemble for a recommendation system with the following requirements:
- Binary classification: User will like/dislike item
- 100,000 users, 10,000 items
- Sparse feature matrix (5% non-zero values)
- Need to handle cold-start users

### Task
1. What type of weak learners would work well with sparse data?
2. How would you handle the cold-start problem?
3. What would be your feature engineering strategy?
4. How would you evaluate the recommendation quality?
5. If you can only use 100 features out of 1000, how would you select them?

## Understanding the Problem
Recommendation systems face unique challenges when using ensemble methods like AdaBoost. The data is typically very sparse (most users haven't interacted with most items), high-dimensional (many users and items), and suffers from cold-start problems (new users/items with no interaction history). AdaBoost can be particularly effective for recommendation systems because it can handle sparse data well and naturally performs feature selection through its iterative process.

## Solution

We'll approach this systematically by analyzing each aspect of building an AdaBoost-based recommendation system, from weak learner selection to feature engineering and evaluation strategies.

### Step 1: Optimal Weak Learners for Sparse Data

**Mathematical Analysis of Weak Learners for Sparse Data:**

Let's analyze why decision stumps are optimal for sparse recommendation data:

**Decision Stumps (Single-Split Trees):**
- **Mathematical Form**: $h_t(x) = \text{sign}(x_j - \theta_t)$ where $x_j$ is a single feature and $\theta_t$ is the threshold
- **Sparsity Handling**: For sparse data with density $d$ (where $d = 0.05$ in our case), most features $x_j = 0$
- **Advantage**: When $x_j = 0$, the decision becomes $\text{sign}(0 - \theta_t) = \text{sign}(-\theta_t)$, which is constant
- **Efficiency**: Only needs to evaluate non-zero features during prediction

**Mathematical Derivation:**
For a feature matrix $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$ with sparsity $d$:
- Expected non-zero elements per sample: $E[\|x_i\|_0] = p \cdot d$
- For $p = 1000$ and $d = 0.05$: $E[\|x_i\|_0] = 50$
- Decision stump complexity: $O(1)$ per prediction (only one feature comparison)
- Full tree complexity: $O(\log_2(\text{depth}))$ per prediction

**Shallow Trees (Depth ≤ 3):**
- **Mathematical Form**: $h_t(x) = \text{sign}(\sum_{j \in S_t} w_{tj}x_j - \theta_t)$ where $S_t$ is a small subset of features
- **Sparsity Handling**: Can capture simple interactions between 2-3 features
- **Trade-off**: More expressive than stumps but may overfit with very sparse data

**Linear Classifiers:**
- **Mathematical Form**: $h_t(x) = \text{sign}(\mathbf{w}_t^T\mathbf{x} - \theta_t)$
- **Sparsity Handling**: Natural for sparse data due to $L_1$ regularization properties
- **Limitation**: Restricted to linear decision boundaries

**Theoretical Justification:**
The optimal weak learner for sparse data minimizes the expected error:
$$\min_{h_t} \mathbb{E}_{D_t}[\mathbb{I}(h_t(x_i) \neq y_i)]$$

For sparse data, decision stumps achieve this because:
1. **Feature Independence**: Each feature contributes independently to the decision
2. **Sparsity Preservation**: Non-zero features are rare, so single-feature decisions are most informative
3. **Computational Efficiency**: $O(1)$ prediction time vs $O(\log d)$ for deeper trees

### Step 2: Handling the Cold-Start Problem

**Mathematical Framework for Cold-Start Solutions:**

**Content-Based Features:**
- **Mathematical Model**: $f_{\text{content}}(u, i) = \mathbf{w}_u^T \mathbf{x}_i + \mathbf{w}_i^T \mathbf{z}_u$
  where $\mathbf{x}_i$ are item features and $\mathbf{z}_u$ are user features
- **Effectiveness Score**: 8/10
- **Implementation**: Include demographic and content features directly in AdaBoost
- **Mathematical Advantage**: Provides immediate recommendations for new users/items

**Popularity-Based Initialization:**
- **Mathematical Model**: $f_{\text{pop}}(i) = \frac{\text{interactions}(i)}{\text{total interactions}}$
- **Effectiveness Score**: 6/10
- **Implementation**: Weight popular items higher in initial recommendations
- **Limitation**: Ignores user preferences, only considers global popularity

**Hybrid Approach (Recommended):**
- **Mathematical Model**: $f_{\text{hybrid}}(u, i) = \alpha f_{\text{collab}}(u, i) + (1-\alpha) f_{\text{content}}(u, i)$
  where $\alpha$ is the mixing parameter
- **Effectiveness Score**: 9/10
- **Implementation**: Combine collaborative filtering with content-based features
- **Mathematical Advantage**: Robust performance across different scenarios

**Active Learning:**
- **Mathematical Model**: Select items to query based on uncertainty: $\text{uncertainty}(u, i) = 1 - |f(u, i) - 0.5|$
- **Effectiveness Score**: 9/10
- **Implementation**: Use AdaBoost's uncertainty estimates to select which items to query
- **Mathematical Advantage**: Maximizes information gain from user feedback

**Theoretical Analysis:**
The cold-start problem can be formalized as:
$$\min_{\mathbf{w}} \sum_{(u,i) \in \mathcal{O}} \ell(f_{\mathbf{w}}(u,i), y_{ui}) + \lambda \sum_{(u,i) \in \mathcal{U}} \text{uncertainty}(u,i)$$

where $\mathcal{O}$ are observed interactions and $\mathcal{U}$ are unobserved user-item pairs.

### Step 3: Feature Engineering Strategy

**Comprehensive Feature Engineering Framework:**

**User Features ($\mathbf{z}_u$):**
- **Demographics**: $z_{u,1} = \text{age\_group}(u)$, $z_{u,2} = \text{gender}(u)$, $z_{u,3} = \text{location}(u)$
- **Behavioral**: $z_{u,4} = \text{activity\_level}(u)$, $z_{u,5} = \text{avg\_session\_duration}(u)$
- **Historical**: $z_{u,6} = \text{avg\_rating}(u)$, $z_{u,7} = \text{rating\_std}(u)$

**Item Features ($\mathbf{x}_i$):**
- **Content**: $x_{i,1} = \text{category}(i)$, $x_{i,2} = \text{price\_normalized}(i)$, $x_{i,3} = \text{brand}(i)$
- **Popularity**: $x_{i,4} = \frac{\text{ratings}(i)}{\max(\text{ratings})}$, $x_{i,5} = \frac{\text{reviews}(i)}{\max(\text{reviews})}$
- **Temporal**: $x_{i,6} = \text{days\_since\_release}(i)$, $x_{i,7} = \text{seasonality}(i)$

**Contextual Features ($\mathbf{c}_{ui}$):**
- **Time**: $c_{ui,1} = \text{hour\_of\_day}$, $c_{ui,2} = \text{day\_of\_week}$, $c_{ui,3} = \text{season}$
- **Device**: $c_{ui,4} = \text{device\_type}$, $c_{ui,5} = \text{browser\_type}$
- **Session**: $c_{ui,6} = \text{session\_length}$, $c_{ui,7} = \text{previous\_interactions}$

**Interaction Features ($\mathbf{f}_{ui}$):**
- **Implicit**: $f_{ui,1} = \text{click\_count}$, $f_{ui,2} = \text{dwell\_time}$, $f_{ui,3} = \text{scroll\_depth}$
- **Explicit**: $f_{ui,4} = \text{rating}$, $f_{ui,5} = \text{review\_sentiment}$
- **Social**: $f_{ui,6} = \text{friend\_recommendations}$, $f_{ui,7} = \text{share\_count}$

**Mathematical Feature Combination:**
The final feature vector for user-item pair $(u,i)$ is:
$$\mathbf{v}_{ui} = [\mathbf{z}_u, \mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{c}_{ui}, \mathbf{f}_{ui}]$$

**Feature Importance Analysis:**
Using AdaBoost's natural feature selection:
$$\text{importance}(j) = \sum_{t=1}^T \alpha_t \cdot \mathbb{I}(\text{feature } j \text{ used in } h_t)$$

where $\alpha_t$ is the weight of weak learner $t$.

### Step 4: Evaluation Metrics for Recommendation Quality

**Mathematical Formulation of Evaluation Metrics:**

**Precision@K:**
- **Mathematical Definition**: $\text{Precision@K} = \frac{|\mathcal{R}_K \cap \mathcal{R}^*|}{|\mathcal{R}_K|}$
  where $\mathcal{R}_K$ are top-K recommendations and $\mathcal{R}^*$ are relevant items
- **Formula**: $\text{Precision@K} = \frac{\text{TP}_K}{\text{TP}_K + \text{FP}_K}$
- **Use Case**: When false positives are costly
- **Typical Values**: 0.1 - 0.3 for K=10

**Recall@K:**
- **Mathematical Definition**: $\text{Recall@K} = \frac{|\mathcal{R}_K \cap \mathcal{R}^*|}{|\mathcal{R}^*|}$
- **Formula**: $\text{Recall@K} = \frac{\text{TP}_K}{\text{TP}_K + \text{FN}_K}$
- **Use Case**: When coverage is important
- **Typical Values**: 0.05 - 0.2 for K=10

**F1@K:**
- **Mathematical Definition**: $\text{F1@K} = \frac{2 \cdot \text{Precision@K} \cdot \text{Recall@K}}{\text{Precision@K} + \text{Recall@K}}$
- **Use Case**: Balanced evaluation
- **Typical Values**: 0.08 - 0.25 for K=10

**NDCG@K (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain):**
- **Mathematical Definition**: $\text{NDCG@K} = \frac{\text{DCG@K}}{\text{IDCG@K}}$
- **DCG Formula**: $\text{DCG@K} = \sum_{i=1}^K \frac{2^{rel_i} - 1}{\log_2(i + 1)}$
  where $rel_i$ is the relevance score of item at position $i$
- **Use Case**: When ranking order matters
- **Typical Values**: 0.1 - 0.4 for K=10

**AUC-ROC:**
- **Mathematical Definition**: $\text{AUC} = \int_0^1 \text{TPR}(f) \cdot \text{FPR}'(f) df$
  where TPR is true positive rate and FPR is false positive rate
- **Use Case**: Overall ranking quality
- **Typical Values**: 0.6 - 0.8 for recommendation systems

**Theoretical Analysis:**
For recommendation systems, these metrics can be related through:
$$\text{AUC} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \text{NDCG@K} \cdot \text{Precision@K}$$

### Step 5: Feature Selection Strategy (1000 → 100 features)

**Mathematical Framework for Feature Selection:**

**AdaBoost Natural Feature Selection:**
AdaBoost automatically performs feature selection through its iterative process:
$$\text{importance}(j) = \sum_{t=1}^T \alpha_t \cdot \mathbb{I}(\text{feature } j \text{ used in } h_t)$$

**Feature Selection Algorithm:**

1. **Train AdaBoost with all features**:
   - Initialize weights: $D_1(i) = \frac{1}{n}$ for all samples
   - For each iteration $t = 1, 2, \ldots, T$:
     - Train weak learner $h_t$ on weighted data
     - Calculate error: $\epsilon_t = \sum_{i: h_t(x_i) \neq y_i} D_t(i)$
     - Calculate weight: $\alpha_t = \frac{1}{2} \ln\left(\frac{1-\epsilon_t}{\epsilon_t}\right)$
     - Update weights: $D_{t+1}(i) = \frac{D_t(i) \exp(-\alpha_t y_i h_t(x_i))}{Z_t}$

2. **Extract feature importance scores**:
   - For each feature $j$: $\text{importance}(j) = \sum_{t=1}^T \alpha_t \cdot \mathbb{I}(\text{feature } j \text{ used in } h_t)$

3. **Select top 100 features**:
   - Sort features by importance: $\text{importance}(j_1) \geq \text{importance}(j_2) \geq \ldots \geq \text{importance}(j_p)$
   - Select top 100: $S = \{j_1, j_2, \ldots, j_{100}\}$

**Mathematical Analysis of Selection Quality:**

**Cumulative Importance Captured:**
$$\text{importance\_captured}(k) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^k \text{importance}(j_i)}{\sum_{i=1}^p \text{importance}(j_i)}$$

**Performance Estimation:**
Using the relationship between feature count and performance:
$$\text{AUC}(k) = \text{AUC}_{\text{full}} \cdot \text{importance\_captured}(k) + \text{AUC}_{\text{baseline}} \cdot (1 - \text{importance\_captured}(k))$$

**Theoretical Bounds:**
For AdaBoost with decision stumps, the generalization error is bounded by:
$$\mathbb{P}(f(x) \neq y) \leq \prod_{t=1}^T \sqrt{2\epsilon_t(1-\epsilon_t)}$$

With feature selection, this becomes:
$$\mathbb{P}(f_S(x) \neq y) \leq \mathbb{P}(f(x) \neq y) + \sqrt{\frac{\log(p/k)}{n}}$$

where $S$ is the selected feature set of size $k$.
