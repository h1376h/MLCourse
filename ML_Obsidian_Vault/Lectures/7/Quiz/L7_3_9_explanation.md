# Question 9: Random Forest Configuration Comparison

## Problem Statement
You have three Random Forest configurations for a dataset with $20$ total features:

**Configuration A:** $100$ trees, $5$ features per split, $\mathrm{max\_depth} = 10$

**Configuration B:** $50$ trees, $10$ features per split, $\mathrm{max\_depth} = 15$

**Configuration C:** $200$ trees, $3$ features per split, $\mathrm{max\_depth} = 8$

### Task
1. Which configuration will likely have the highest tree diversity?
2. Which configuration will be fastest to train?
   - Training speed $\propto$ trees × depth × features per split
3. Which configuration will likely have the lowest variance in predictions?
   - Variance: more trees = lower variance, deeper trees = higher variance
4. If you have limited memory, which configuration would you choose?
   - Memory $\propto 2^{\mathrm{depth}} \times \mathrm{trees}$

## Understanding the Problem
Random Forests are ensemble methods that combine multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting. The performance characteristics of a Random Forest depend on several key hyperparameters:

- **n_estimators**: Number of trees in the forest
- **max_features**: Maximum number of features considered at each split
- **max_depth**: Maximum depth of each tree

These parameters create trade-offs between model complexity, training time, memory usage, and prediction stability. Understanding these trade-offs is crucial for selecting appropriate configurations for different scenarios.

## Solution

### Step 1: Tree Diversity Analysis
Tree diversity in Random Forests is influenced by:
1. **Feature selection randomness**: Lower `max_features` values create more randomness in feature selection
2. **Bootstrap sampling**: Creates different training sets for each tree
3. **Number of trees**: More trees provide greater overall diversity

**Diversity Metrics Calculation:**
- **Feature diversity score**: $1 - \frac{\mathrm{max\_features}}{\mathrm{total\_features}}$
- **Tree diversity score**: $\min(\frac{\mathrm{n\_estimators}}{100}, 1.0)$
- **Combined diversity score**: $0.7 \times \mathrm{feature\_diversity} + 0.3 \times \mathrm{tree\_diversity}$

**Step-by-Step Calculations:**

**Configuration A:**
- **Step 1: Feature Diversity**
  - Formula: $1 - \frac{\mathrm{max\_features}}{\mathrm{total\_features}} = 1 - \frac{5}{20} = 1 - 0.250 = 0.750$
  - Mathematical reasoning: Lower max_features creates more randomness in feature selection, leading to higher diversity
  - Range: 0 (no diversity) to 1 (maximum diversity)

- **Step 2: Tree Diversity**
  - Formula: $\min(\frac{\mathrm{n\_estimators}}{100}, 1.0) = \min(\frac{100}{100}, 1.0) = \min(1.000, 1.0) = 1.000$
  - Mathematical reasoning: More trees provide greater ensemble diversity, normalized by dividing by 100 and capped at 1.0

- **Step 3: Combined Diversity**
  - Formula: $0.7 \times \mathrm{feature\_diversity} + 0.3 \times \mathrm{tree\_diversity}$
  - Calculation: $0.7 \times 0.750 + 0.3 \times 1.000 = 0.525 + 0.300 = 0.825$
  - Final score: 0.825 (higher = better)

**Configuration B:**
- **Step 1: Feature Diversity**
  - Formula: $1 - \frac{10}{20} = 1 - 0.500 = 0.500$
  - Mathematical reasoning: Higher max_features reduces randomness, leading to lower diversity

- **Step 2: Tree Diversity**
  - Formula: $\min(\frac{50}{100}, 1.0) = \min(0.500, 1.0) = 0.500$
  - Mathematical reasoning: Fewer trees result in lower tree diversity

- **Step 3: Combined Diversity**
  - Formula: $0.7 \times 0.500 + 0.3 \times 0.500 = 0.350 + 0.150 = 0.500$
  - Final score: 0.500 (higher = better)

**Configuration C:**
- **Step 1: Feature Diversity**
  - Formula: $1 - \frac{3}{20} = 1 - 0.150 = 0.850$
  - Mathematical reasoning: Lowest max_features creates maximum randomness and highest diversity

- **Step 2: Tree Diversity**
  - Formula: $\min(\frac{200}{100}, 1.0) = \min(2.000, 1.0) = 1.000$
  - Mathematical reasoning: More trees provide maximum tree diversity (capped at 1.0)

- **Step 3: Combined Diversity**
  - Formula: $0.7 \times 0.850 + 0.3 \times 1.000 = 0.595 + 0.300 = 0.895$
  - Final score: 0.895 (highest among all configurations)

**Answer 1:** Configuration C has the highest tree diversity ($0.895$).

### Step 2: Training Speed Analysis
Training speed is influenced by:
1. **Number of trees**: More trees require more computation time
2. **Maximum depth**: Deeper trees require more time to build
3. **Features per split**: More features per split can increase computation

**Theoretical Training Time Complexity:**
- **Complexity factor**: $\mathrm{n\_estimators} \times \mathrm{max\_depth} \times \mathrm{max\_features}$
- **Relative training time**: $\frac{\mathrm{complexity\_factor}}{\mathrm{baseline\_value}}$

**Mathematical Reasoning:**
- Each tree requires time proportional to its depth
- Each split considers max_features features
- Total time = sum over all trees
- Formula: $T_{\mathrm{total}} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (T_{\mathrm{depth}_{i}} \times \mathrm{max\_features}_{i})$
- For uniform trees: $T_{\mathrm{total}} = n_{\mathrm{trees}} \times \mathrm{max\_depth} \times \mathrm{max\_features}$

**Step-by-Step Calculations:**

**Baseline Configuration:** Configuration C (baseline_value = $200 \times 8 \times 3 = 4800$)

### Step 3: Prediction Variance Analysis
Prediction variance is influenced by:
1. **Number of trees**: More trees generally reduce variance through averaging
2. **Tree depth**: Deeper trees can increase variance due to overfitting
3. **Feature randomness**: More randomness in feature selection can increase variance

**Variance Metrics:**
- **Tree variance reduction**: $\frac{1}{\sqrt{\mathrm{n\_estimators}}}$
- **Depth variance factor**: $\min(\frac{\mathrm{max\_depth}}{20}, 1.0)$
- **Feature variance factor**: $\frac{\mathrm{max\_features}}{\mathrm{total\_features}}$
- **Combined variance score**: $0.5 \times \mathrm{tree\_reduction} + 0.3 \times \mathrm{depth\_factor} + 0.2 \times \mathrm{feature\_factor}$

**Mathematical Reasoning:**
- **Tree variance**: follows $1/\sqrt{n}$ law from ensemble theory
- **Depth variance**: deeper trees = higher variance (overfitting)

  - Normalized by dividing by 20 (typical max depth) and capped at 1.0; higher values = higher variance (worse)

- **Step 3: Feature Variance Factor**
  - Formula: $\frac{\mathrm{max\_features}}{\mathrm{total\_features}} = \frac{5}{20} = 0.250$
  - Mathematical explanation: More features per split = less randomness = lower variance
  - Range: 0 (maximum randomness) to 1 (no randomness); lower values = higher randomness = higher variance

- **Step 4: Combined Variance Score**
  - Formula: $0.5 \times \mathrm{tree\_reduction} + 0.3 \times \mathrm{depth\_factor} + 0.2 \times \mathrm{feature\_factor}$
  - Calculation: $0.5 \times 0.100 + 0.3 \times 0.500 + 0.2 \times 0.250 = 0.050 + 0.150 + 0.050 = 0.250$

- **Step 4: Combined Variance Score**
  - Formula: $0.5 \times 0.141 + 0.3 \times 0.750 + 0.2 \times 0.500 = 0.071 + 0.225 + 0.100 = 0.396$
  - Final variance score: 0.396 (higher variance than Configuration A)

**Configuration C:**
- **Step 1: Tree Variance Reduction**
  - Formula: $\frac{1}{\sqrt{200}} = \frac{1}{14.142} = 0.071$
  - Mathematical explanation: Most trees provide the best variance reduction through ensemble averaging

- **Step 2: Depth Variance Factor**
  - Formula: $\min(\frac{8}{20}, 1.0) = \min(0.400, 1.0) = 0.400$
  - Mathematical explanation: Shallow trees (depth 8) minimize overfitting and variance

- **Step 3: Feature Variance Factor**
  - Formula: $\frac{3}{20} = 0.150$
