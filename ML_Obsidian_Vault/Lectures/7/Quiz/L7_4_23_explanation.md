## Problem Statement
Investigate AdaBoost's performance on streaming data.

**Scenario:**
- Data arrives continuously
- Concept drift may occur
- Need to update model incrementally
- Memory constraints limit ensemble size

### Task
1. What challenges does streaming data pose for AdaBoost?
2. How would you modify AdaBoost for online learning?
3. What would be your concept drift detection strategy?
4. How would you manage memory constraints?
5. If you can only store 50 weak learners, how would you decide which to keep?

## Understanding the Problem
Streaming data presents fundamental challenges for traditional AdaBoost: the algorithm was designed for batch learning with fixed datasets, but streaming scenarios require continuous adaptation to new data while managing memory constraints and handling concept drift. The key is developing an online variant that maintains AdaBoost's strengths while adapting to the dynamic nature of streaming data.

## Solution

### Task 3: Online AdaBoost Implementation

**Algorithm Adaptation:**

**Key Adaptations:**
- **Incremental Learning**: Process data in small batches
- **Memory Management**: Maintain sliding window of recent samples
- **Drift Adaptation**: Retrain or prune weak learners when drift detected
- **Weight Updates**: Adapt sample weights based on recent performance

**Mathematical Framework for Online Adaptation:**

The traditional AdaBoost algorithm updates sample weights as:
$$w_i^{(t+1)} = w_i^{(t)} \cdot e^{-\alpha_t \cdot y_i \cdot h_t(x_i)}$$

For online learning, we need to modify this to handle streaming data:

1. **Incremental Weight Updates**: 
   - Process new samples with initial weights $w_{\text{new}} = \frac{1}{n_{\text{new}}}$
   - Update existing weights using exponential decay: $w_i^{(t+1)} = w_i^{(t)} \cdot \lambda^{\Delta t}$
   - Where $\lambda$ is the forgetting factor and $\Delta t$ is time since last update

2. **Ensemble Size Management**:
   - Maintain maximum ensemble size $M$
   - When $|\mathcal{H}| > M$, remove weakest learner based on:
   $$\text{weakest} = \arg\min_{h \in \mathcal{H}} \frac{\alpha_h}{\sum_{h' \in \mathcal{H}} \alpha_{h'}}$$

3. **Memory Buffer Strategy**:
   - Use sliding window of size $W$
   - Sample importance decays exponentially: $p(x_i) \propto e^{-\gamma \cdot (t - t_i)}$
   - Where $\gamma$ controls forgetting rate and $t_i$ is when sample $i$ arrived
