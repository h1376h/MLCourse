# Question 23: AdaBoost for Streaming Data

## Problem Statement
Investigate AdaBoost's performance on streaming data.

**Scenario:**
- Data arrives continuously
- Concept drift may occur
- Need to update model incrementally
- Memory constraints limit ensemble size

### Task
1. What challenges does streaming data pose for AdaBoost?
2. How would you modify AdaBoost for online learning?

5. If you can only store 50 weak learners, how would you decide which to keep?

## Understanding the Problem
Streaming data presents fundamental challenges for traditional AdaBoost: the algorithm was designed for batch learning with fixed datasets, but streaming scenarios require continuous adaptation to new data while managing memory constraints and handling concept drift.

        self.memory_limit = memory_limit
        self.weak_learners = []
        self.alphas = []
        self.memory_buffer = deque(maxlen=memory_limit)
        
    def partial_fit(self, X, y):
        # Update memory buffer
        self.memory_buffer.extend(zip(X, y))
        
        # Train new weak learner on recent data
        if len(self.memory_buffer) >= batch_size:
