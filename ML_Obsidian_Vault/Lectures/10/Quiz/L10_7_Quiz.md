# Lecture 10.7: Bootstrap and Resampling Methods Quiz

## Overview
This quiz contains 5 questions covering different topics from section 10.7 of the lectures on Bootstrap and Resampling Methods, including bootstrap concept, bootstrap estimation, confidence intervals, bootstrap types, and advantages/limitations.

## Question 1

### Problem Statement
Bootstrap is a resampling technique that samples with replacement.

#### Task
1. [🔍] What does "sampling with replacement" mean?
2. [🔍] How many bootstrap samples can you create from a dataset of size $n$?
3. [🔍] What is the probability that a specific data point is included in a bootstrap sample?
4. [🔍] Why is bootstrap useful for small datasets?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 1: Bootstrap Concept and Mechanics](L10_7_1_explanation.md).

## Question 2

### Problem Statement
Bootstrap can be used to estimate various statistics.

#### Task
1. [📚] How do you estimate the mean using bootstrap?
2. [📚] How do you estimate the standard deviation using bootstrap?
3. [📚] What is the bootstrap distribution of a statistic?
4. [📚] How many bootstrap samples do you typically need?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 2: Bootstrap Estimation Process](L10_7_2_explanation.md).

## Question 3

### Problem Statement
Bootstrap confidence intervals provide uncertainty estimates.

#### Task
1. [📚] How do you construct a 95% bootstrap confidence interval?
2. [📚] What is the percentile method for bootstrap CIs?
3. [📚] What is the bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) method?
4. [📚] When are bootstrap confidence intervals most reliable?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 3: Bootstrap Confidence Intervals](L10_7_3_explanation.md).

## Question 4

### Problem Statement
Different bootstrap variants serve different purposes.

#### Task
1. [📚] What is the difference between parametric and non-parametric bootstrap?
2. [📚] What is the wild bootstrap and when is it used?
3. [📚] What is the block bootstrap for time series data?
4. [📚] How do you choose the appropriate bootstrap method?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 4: Bootstrap Types and Variants](L10_7_4_explanation.md).

## Question 5

### Problem Statement
Bootstrap has both advantages and limitations.

#### Task
1. [📚] **Advantage 1**: How does bootstrap handle non-normal data?
2. [📚] **Advantage 2**: What makes bootstrap computationally efficient?
3. [📚] **Limitation 1**: When does bootstrap fail to work properly?
4. [📚] **Limitation 2**: What are the computational requirements of bootstrap?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 5: Bootstrap Advantages and Limitations](L10_7_5_explanation.md).
