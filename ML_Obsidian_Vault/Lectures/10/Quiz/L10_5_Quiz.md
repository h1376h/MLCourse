# Lecture 10.5: Validation Methods Quiz

## Overview
This quiz contains 5 questions covering different topics from section 10.5 of the lectures on Validation Methods, including validation overview, holdout method, cross-validation, leave-one-out, and stratified validation.

## Question 1

### Problem Statement
Validation is crucial for assessing model performance on unseen data.

#### Task
1. [🔍] Why is validation important in machine learning?
2. [🔍] What is the difference between training, validation, and test sets?
3. [🔍] What happens if you don't use validation?
4. [🔍] How do you ensure validation results are reliable?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 1: Validation Importance and Purpose](L10_5_1_explanation.md).

## Question 2

### Problem Statement
The holdout method is the simplest validation approach.

#### Task
1. [📚] How does the holdout method work?
2. [📚] What are typical train/test split ratios?
3. [📚] What are the advantages of the holdout method?
4. [📚] What are the limitations of the holdout method?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 2: Holdout Method Implementation](L10_5_2_explanation.md).

## Question 3

### Problem Statement
Cross-validation provides more robust performance estimates.

#### Task
1. [📚] How does k-fold cross-validation work?
2. [📚] What is the difference between 5-fold and 10-fold CV?
3. [📚] How do you choose the optimal k value?
4. [📚] What are the tradeoffs between different k values?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 3: K-Fold Cross-Validation](L10_5_3_explanation.md).

## Question 4

### Problem Statement
Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) is a special case of cross-validation.

#### Task
1. [📚] How does LOOCV work?
2. [📚] What is the computational cost of LOOCV?
3. [📚] When is LOOCV most appropriate?
4. [📚] What are the advantages and disadvantages of LOOCV?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 4: Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation](L10_5_4_explanation.md).

## Question 5

### Problem Statement
Stratified validation maintains class distribution across folds.

#### Task
1. [📚] What is stratified sampling and why is it important?
2. [📚] How does stratified cross-validation work?
3. [📚] When should you use stratified vs regular cross-validation?
4. [📚] How do you implement stratified validation for regression problems?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 5: Stratified Validation Methods](L10_5_5_explanation.md).
