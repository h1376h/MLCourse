# Lecture 10.3: Regression Evaluation Metrics Quiz

## Overview
This quiz contains 5 questions covering different topics from section 10.3 of the lectures on Regression Evaluation Metrics, including MSE, MAE, R-squared, adjusted R-squared, and metric interpretation.

## Question 1

### Problem Statement
Consider the following regression predictions and actual values:

| Sample | Actual | Predicted |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| 1      | 10     | 12        |
| 2      | 15     | 14        |
| 3      | 20     | 18        |
| 4      | 25     | 26        |
| 5      | 30     | 28        |

#### Task
1. [🔍] Calculate the Mean Squared Error (MSE)
2. [🔍] Calculate the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
3. [🔍] Calculate the Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
4. [🔍] Which metric is more sensitive to outliers and why?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 1: Basic Regression Metrics](L10_3_1_explanation.md).

## Question 2

### Problem Statement
Mean Squared Error (MSE) is a common regression evaluation metric.

#### Task
1. [📚] What is the mathematical formula for MSE?
2. [📚] What are the units of MSE?
3. [📚] Why is MSE commonly used in regression?
4. [📚] What are the limitations of MSE?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 2: MSE Properties and Interpretation](L10_3_2_explanation.md).

## Question 3

### Problem Statement
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) provides an alternative to MSE.

#### Task
1. [📚] What is the mathematical formula for MAE?
2. [📚] What are the units of MAE?
3. [📚] How does MAE differ from MSE in terms of outlier sensitivity?
4. [📚] When would you prefer MAE over MSE?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 3: MAE vs MSE Comparison](L10_3_3_explanation.md).

## Question 4

### Problem Statement
R-squared measures the proportion of variance explained by the model.

#### Task
1. [📚] What is the mathematical formula for R-squared?
2. [📚] What range of values can R-squared take?
3. [📚] What does an R-squared of 0, 0.5, and 1.0 mean?
4. [📚] What are the limitations of R-squared?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 4: R-Squared Interpretation](L10_3_4_explanation.md).

## Question 5

### Problem Statement
Adjusted R-squared penalizes for adding unnecessary features.

#### Task
1. [📚] What is the mathematical formula for adjusted R-squared?
2. [📚] How does adjusted R-squared differ from regular R-squared?
3. [📚] When does adjusted R-squared increase vs decrease?
4. [📚] How do you use adjusted R-squared for model selection?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 5: Adjusted R-Squared and Model Selection](L10_3_5_explanation.md).
