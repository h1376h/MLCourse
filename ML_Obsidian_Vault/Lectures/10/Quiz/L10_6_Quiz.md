# Lecture 10.6: Sampling Techniques and Strategies Quiz

## Overview
This quiz contains 5 questions covering different topics from section 10.6 of the lectures on Sampling Techniques and Strategies, including sampling overview, random sampling, stratified sampling, systematic sampling, and cluster sampling.

## Question 1

### Problem Statement
Different sampling approaches serve different purposes in machine learning.

#### Task
1. [🔍] What is the difference between probability and non-probability sampling?
2. [🔍] Why is random sampling important for validation?
3. [🔍] What is the goal of representative sampling?
4. [🔍] How do sampling techniques affect model evaluation?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 1: Sampling Overview and Purpose](L10_6_1_explanation.md).

## Question 2

### Problem Statement
Simple random sampling is the most basic sampling technique.

#### Task
1. [📚] How does simple random sampling work?
2. [📚] What are the advantages of random sampling?
3. [📚] What are the limitations of random sampling?
4. [📚] How do you implement random sampling in practice?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 2: Random Sampling Implementation](L10_6_2_explanation.md).

## Question 3

### Problem Statement
Stratified sampling maintains proportions across different groups.

#### Task
1. [📚] What is stratified sampling and when is it used?
2. [📚] How do you implement stratified sampling?
3. [📚] What are the advantages of stratified over random sampling?
4. [📚] How do you choose strata for your data?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 3: Stratified Sampling Methods](L10_6_3_explanation.md).

## Question 4

### Problem Statement
Systematic sampling selects samples at regular intervals.

#### Task

2. [📚] What is the sampling interval and how is it calculated?
3. [📚] What are the advantages of systematic sampling?
4. [📚] What are the potential problems with systematic sampling?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 4: Systematic Sampling Process](L10_6_4_explanation.md).

## Question 5

### Problem Statement
Cluster sampling groups data into clusters before sampling.

#### Task
1. [📚] How does cluster sampling differ from other methods?
2. [📚] What are the steps in cluster sampling?
3. [📚] When is cluster sampling most appropriate?
4. [📚] What are the tradeoffs of cluster sampling?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 5: Cluster Sampling and Tradeoffs](L10_6_5_explanation.md).
