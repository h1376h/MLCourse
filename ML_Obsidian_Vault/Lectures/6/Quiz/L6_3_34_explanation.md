# Question 34: Decision Tree Card Game

## Problem Statement
Design a "Decision Tree Card Game" where you must build the best tree using limited information and strategic choices.

**Game Setup**: You have a deck of "Data Cards" and must build a decision tree by making strategic splitting choices. Each card represents a training sample, and you can only look at one feature at a time before deciding.

**Your Hand of Data Cards**:

| Card | Weather | Temperature | Humidity | Activity |
|------|---------|-------------|----------|----------|
| 1    | Sunny   | Warm        | Low      | Hike     |
| 2    | Sunny   | Cool        | High     | Read     |
| 3    | Rainy   | Cool        | High     | Read     |
| 4    | Cloudy  | Warm        | Low      | Hike     |
| 5    | Rainy   | Warm        | Low      | Read     |
| 6    | Cloudy  | Cool        | Low      | Hike     |

### Task
1. **Feature Analysis**: Without calculating entropy, rank the three features by how "useful" they appear for predicting Activity. Explain your intuitive reasoning.
2. **Split Strategy**: If you could only use ONE feature to split the data, which would you choose and why? Draw the resulting tree.
3. **Verification**: Now calculate the information gain for your chosen feature to verify your intuition was correct.
4. **Tree Construction**: Build the complete decision tree using ID3 algorithm (show your work for the first two levels).
5. **CART Comparison**: Now build the tree using CART algorithm with BOTH Gini impurity and entropy. Compare the resulting trees - are they identical? Explain any differences.
6. **Creative Challenge**: Design a new data card that would make your tree misclassify. What does this reveal about decision tree limitations?

## Understanding the Problem
This problem demonstrates the fundamental concepts of decision tree construction and algorithm selection. We must understand:

- **Information Gain**: How much a feature reduces uncertainty about the target variable
- **Entropy**: Measure of impurity or uncertainty in a dataset
- **Tree Construction**: The recursive process of building decision trees
- **Algorithm Differences**: How ID3 and CART approach tree building differently

The key insight is that different features provide varying levels of predictive power, and the choice of splitting criterion can significantly impact the resulting tree structure.

## Solution

We will systematically analyze each feature's predictive power, construct decision trees using different algorithms, and compare their performance to understand the trade-offs involved.

### Step 1: Feature Analysis
**Intuitive Ranking (without calculation):**
1. **Weather** - seems most predictive (clear patterns)
2. **Temperature** - moderate predictive power  
3. **Humidity** - least predictive (mostly Low values)

**Reasoning**: Looking at the data, Weather shows the clearest patterns:
- Sunny: Mixed activities (Hike, Read)
- Cloudy: Always Hike
- Rainy: Always Read

Temperature shows some correlation but less clear than Weather, while Humidity is mostly "Low" with only 2 "High" values, making it less informative.

**Mathematical Calculation and Verification:**

**Initial Entropy Calculation:**
- Total samples: 6
- Class distribution: Hike: 3, Read: 3
- Initial entropy: $H(S) = -\sum_{i} p_i \log_2(p_i) = -(\frac{3}{6} \log_2(\frac{3}{6}) + \frac{3}{6} \log_2(\frac{3}{6})) = -(\frac{1}{2} \times (-1) + \frac{1}{2} \times (-1)) = 1.0000$

**Information Gain Calculations:**
- **Weather**: IG = 0.6667 (highest)
  - Sunny: 2 samples, weight = 0.333, entropy = 1.0000 (mixed: ['Hike', 'Read'])
  - Rainy: 2 samples, weight = 0.333, entropy = 0.0000 (pure: ['Read', 'Read'])
  - Cloudy: 2 samples, weight = 0.333, entropy = 0.0000 (pure: ['Hike', 'Hike'])
  - Weighted entropy: $0.333 \times 1.0000 + 0.333 \times 0.0000 + 0.333 \times 0.0000 = 0.3333$
  - IG = $1.0000 - 0.3333 = 0.6667$

- **Humidity**: IG = 0.4591 (medium)
  - Low: 4 samples, weight = 0.667, entropy = 0.8113 (mixed: ['Hike', 'Hike', 'Read', 'Hike'])
  - High: 2 samples, weight = 0.333, entropy = 0.0000 (pure: ['Read', 'Read'])

- **Temperature**: IG = 0.0817 (lowest)
  - Warm: 3 samples, weight = 0.500, entropy = 0.9183 (mixed: ['Hike', 'Hike', 'Read'])
  - Cool: 3 samples, weight = 0.500, entropy = 0.9183 (mixed: ['Read', 'Read', 'Hike'])

**Result**: Our intuition was correct! Weather has the highest information gain by a significant margin.

### Step 2: Split Strategy
**Best feature to split on: Weather (IG = 0.6667)**

**Reasoning**: Weather shows the clearest patterns for predicting Activity and has the highest information gain. It creates the most meaningful separation of the data.

**Resulting Tree Structure:**
```
Root (Weather)
├── Sunny → Further split needed (mixed activities)
├── Cloudy → Activity: Hike (pure)
└── Rainy → Activity: Read (pure)
```

**Data Split Analysis:**
- **Weather = Sunny**: ['Hike', 'Read'] → Mixed (needs further splitting)
- **Weather = Cloudy**: ['Hike', 'Hike'] → Pure (all Hike)
- **Weather = Rainy**: ['Read', 'Read'] → Pure (all Read)

**Mathematical Justification:**
- **Sunny branch**: 2 samples, entropy = 1.0000 (mixed activities)
- **Cloudy branch**: 2 samples, entropy = 0.0000 (pure, all Hike)
- **Rainy branch**: 2 samples, entropy = 0.0000 (pure, all Read)
- **Total weighted entropy**: $0.333 \times 1.0000 + 0.333 \times 0.0000 + 0.333 \times 0.0000 = 0.3333$
- **Information Gain**: $1.0000 - 0.3333 = 0.6667$ ✓

### Step 3: Verification
**Verification confirms our intuition!**

Weather has the highest information gain: 0.6667, which is significantly higher than both Temperature (0.0817) and Humidity (0.4591). This validates our initial assessment that Weather is the most predictive feature.

**Detailed Verification Calculations:**

**Feature-by-Feature Analysis:**
- **Weather**: IG = 0.6667 (highest)
  - Sunny: 2 samples, entropy = 1.0000, weight = 0.333
  - Rainy: 2 samples, entropy = 0.0000, weight = 0.333  
  - Cloudy: 2 samples, entropy = 0.0000, weight = 0.333
  - Weighted entropy: $0.333 \times 1.0000 + 0.333 \times 0.0000 + 0.333 \times 0.0000 = 0.3333$
  - IG = $1.0000 - 0.3333 = 0.6667$

- **Humidity**: IG = 0.4591 (second)
  - Low: 4 samples, entropy = 0.8113, weight = 0.667
  - High: 2 samples, entropy = 0.0000, weight = 0.333
  - Weighted entropy: $0.667 \times 0.8113 + 0.333 \times 0.0000 = 0.5409$
  - IG = $1.0000 - 0.5409 = 0.4591$

- **Temperature**: IG = 0.0817 (lowest)
  - Warm: 3 samples, entropy = 0.9183, weight = 0.500
  - Cool: 3 samples, entropy = 0.9183, weight = 0.500
  - Weighted entropy: $0.500 \times 0.9183 + 0.500 \times 0.9183 = 0.9183$
  - IG = $1.0000 - 0.9183 = 0.0817$

**Final Ranking**: Weather (0.6667) > Humidity (0.4591) > Temperature (0.0817) ✓

### Step 4: ID3 Tree Construction
**Complete ID3 Tree Structure:**
```
Split on Weather (Gain: 0.6667, Entropy: 1.0000)
  Weather = Sunny:
    Split on Temperature (Gain: 1.0000, Entropy: 1.0000)
      Temperature = Warm:
        Leaf: Hike (Entropy: 0.0000)
      Temperature = Cool:
        Leaf: Read (Entropy: 0.0000)
  Weather = Rainy:
    Leaf: Read (Entropy: 0.0000)
  Weather = Cloudy:
    Leaf: Hike (Entropy: 0.0000)
```

**Key Observations:**
- **Root Node**: Weather with entropy 1.0000 (maximum uncertainty)
- **First Level**: Three branches (Sunny, Cloudy, Rainy)
- **Second Level**: Only Sunny branch needs further splitting on Temperature
- **Final Depth**: 2 levels maximum
- **Pure Leaves**: All leaf nodes have entropy 0.0000 (perfect classification)

**Detailed Construction Process:**

**Level 1 - Root Node Selection:**
- **Feature**: Weather (selected because IG = 0.6667 is highest)
- **Entropy**: $H(S) = 1.0000$ (maximum uncertainty)

**Level 1 - Split on Weather:**
- **Weather = Sunny**: 2 samples, entropy = 1.0000, weight = 0.333
  - Activities: ['Hike', 'Read'] → Mixed (needs further splitting)
  - Weighted entropy: $0.333 \times 1.0000 = 0.3333$
- **Weather = Rainy**: 2 samples, entropy = 0.0000, weight = 0.333
  - Activities: ['Read', 'Read'] → Pure (all Read)
  - Weighted entropy: $0.333 \times 0.0000 = 0.0000$
- **Weather = Cloudy**: 2 samples, entropy = 0.0000, weight = 0.333
  - Activities: ['Hike', 'Hike'] → Pure (all Hike)
  - Weighted entropy: $0.333 \times 0.0000 = 0.0000$

**Level 2 - Further Split for Sunny Branch:**
- **Sunny subset**: ['Hike', 'Read'] (entropy = 1.0000)
- **Feature selection**: Need to find best feature among remaining features
- **IG(Temperature) = 1.0000** (perfect split)
- **IG(Humidity) = 1.0000** (also perfect split)
- **Selected**: Temperature (arbitrary choice between equal gains)

**Level 2 - Split on Temperature:**
- **Temperature = Warm**: 1 sample, entropy = 0.0000 (pure, Hike)
- **Temperature = Cool**: 1 sample, entropy = 0.0000 (pure, Read)
- **Result**: Perfect classification achieved

**Mathematical Verification:**
- **Total weighted entropy**: $0.3333 + 0.0000 + 0.0000 = 0.3333$
- **Information Gain**: $1.0000 - 0.3333 = 0.6667$ ✓
- **Tree depth**: 2 levels maximum
- **All leaf nodes**: entropy = 0.0000 (perfect classification)





**Feature Ranking Confirmed:**
1. Weather (IG: 0.6667) - Most predictive
2. Humidity (IG: 0.4591) - Moderate predictive power
3. Temperature (IG: 0.0817) - Least predictive

### Step 5: CART Comparison

**CART Tree with Gini Impurity:**
```
Split on Weather (Gain: 0.3333, Impurity: 0.5000)
  Weather = Sunny:
    Split on Temperature (Gain: 0.5000, Impurity: 0.5000)
      Temperature = Warm:
        Leaf: Hike (Impurity: 0.0000)
      Temperature = Cool:
        Leaf: Read (Impurity: 0.0000)
  Weather = Rainy:
    Leaf: Read (Impurity: 0.0000)
  Weather = Cloudy:
    Leaf: Hike (Impurity: 0.0000)
```

**CART Tree with Entropy:**
```
Split on Weather (Gain: 0.6667, Impurity: 1.0000)
  Weather = Sunny:
    Split on Temperature (Gain: 1.0000, Impurity: 1.0000)
      Temperature = Warm:
        Leaf: Hike (Impurity: 0.0000)
      Temperature = Cool:
        Leaf: Read (Impurity: 0.0000)
  Weather = Rainy:
    Leaf: Read (Entropy: 0.0000)
  Weather = Cloudy:
    Leaf: Hike (Entropy: 0.0000)
```

**Comparison Analysis:**
- **Tree Structure**: All three approaches produce identical tree structures
- **Root Feature**: All select Weather as the root feature
- **Split Values**: Same branching pattern and leaf assignments
- **Gain Values**: 
  - ID3: 0.6667 (entropy-based)
  - CART Gini: 0.3333 (Gini-based)
  - CART Entropy: 0.6667 (entropy-based)

**Why They're Identical:**
1. **Feature Selection**: All impurity measures agree that Weather is the best feature
2. **Small Dataset**: With only 6 samples, the differences between algorithms are minimal
3. **Clear Patterns**: The data has strong, unambiguous patterns that all algorithms can detect

**Detailed Mathematical Comparison:**

**ID3 (Entropy-based):**
- Information Gain: 0.6667
- Split criterion: $IG(S, Weather) = H(S) - \sum_{v} \frac{|S_v|}{|S|} H(S_v)$

**CART (Gini-based):**
- Gini Gain: 0.3333
- Split criterion: $GiniGain(S, Weather) = Gini(S) - \sum_{v} \frac{|S_v|}{|S|} Gini(S_v)$
- Where $Gini(S) = 1 - \sum_{i} p_i^2 = 1 - (\frac{3}{6})^2 - (\frac{3}{6})^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = 0.5000$

**CART (Entropy-based):**
- Information Gain: 0.6667 (same as ID3)
- Uses same entropy formula but with binary splitting strategy

**Detailed Gini Calculations:**
- **Initial Gini**: $G(S) = 1 - (\frac{3}{6})^2 - (\frac{3}{6})^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = 0.5000$
- **Weather Gini Gain**: 0.3333
- **Temperature Gini Gain**: 0.0556
- **Humidity Gini Gain**: 0.2500

**Why All Algorithms Select Weather:**
- **Entropy-based**: Weather has highest information gain (0.6667)
- **Gini-based**: Weather has highest Gini gain (0.3333)
- **Feature ranking is consistent** across all impurity measures



### Step 6: Creative Challenge
**New data card that would cause misclassification:**
- **Weather**: Sunny
- **Temperature**: Warm  
- **Humidity**: High
- **Activity**: Read

**Conflict Analysis:**
This contradicts the established pattern: **Sunny + Warm + Low Humidity → Hike**

**What This Reveals About Decision Tree Limitations:**
1. **Overfitting**: The tree learns specific feature combinations rather than generalizable rules
2. **Missing Context**: Humidity might be more important than the tree structure suggests
3. **Limited Generalization**: The tree may not handle edge cases well
4. **Feature Interactions**: The tree doesn't capture complex interactions between features

**Detailed Pattern Analysis:**
The code systematically analyzed all existing feature combinations:
- **Sunny + Warm + Low** → Hike
- **Sunny + Cool + High** → Read
- **Rainy + Cool + High** → Read
- **Cloudy + Warm + Low** → Hike
- **Rainy + Warm + Low** → Read
- **Cloudy + Cool + Low** → Hike

**Systematic Misclassification Design:**
1. **Contradicting Pattern**: Sunny + Warm + High → Read
   - **Conflict**: Changes Humidity from Low to High, but activity changes from Hike to Read
   - **Implication**: Humidity might be more important than the tree structure suggests

2. **Creating Uncertainty**: Cloudy + Cool + High → ?
   - **Issue**: No existing pattern for this combination
   - **Problem**: Tree must make decision with insufficient information

3. **Edge Case**: Rainy + Cool + Low → ?
   - **Challenge**: This combination doesn't exist in training data
   - **Limitation**: Tree cannot generalize to unseen combinations

**Mathematical Impact Analysis:**
- **Original pattern**: Sunny + Warm + Low → Hike (entropy = 0, pure)
- **New card**: Sunny + Warm + High → Read (creates mixed subset)
- **Result**: Sunny + Warm branch would no longer be pure, requiring further splitting
- **Tree modification**: Would need to consider Humidity for Sunny + Warm combinations

**Quantitative Analysis:**
- **Current Sunny + Warm branch**: entropy = 0.0000 (pure, all Hike)
- **With new card**: entropy would increase (mixed: Hike, Read)
- **Implication**: Tree structure would need modification to handle this case
- **Feature importance**: Humidity becomes more critical for Sunny + Warm combinations

- **Temperature = Cool**: 1 sample, entropy = 0.0000 (pure, Read)
- **Result**: Perfect classification achieved

**Mathematical Verification:**
- **Total weighted entropy**: 0.3333 + 0.0000 + 0.0000 = 0.3333
- **Information Gain**: 1.0000 - 0.3333 = 0.6667 ✓

The solution demonstrates that **intuition and mathematical rigor can align perfectly** when the data has clear patterns. All three algorithms (ID3, CART Gini, CART Entropy) produce identical trees because:
