# Lecture 6.8: Advanced Decision Tree Topics Quiz

## Overview
This quiz contains 5 questions covering different topics from section 6.8 of the lectures on Advanced Decision Tree Topics, including regression trees, multi-output trees, online learning, and tree visualization.

## Question 1

### Problem Statement
Decision trees can be used for regression problems, not just classification.

#### Task
1. [🔍] What is the main difference between classification and regression trees?
2. [🔍] How do regression trees make predictions?
3. [🔍] What is the splitting criterion for regression trees?
4. [🔍] How do you evaluate the quality of a regression tree?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 1: Regression Trees](L6_8_1_explanation.md).

## Question 2

### Problem Statement
Multi-output trees can predict multiple target variables simultaneously.

#### Task
1. [📚] What is a multi-output tree and when is it useful?
2. [📚] How do you calculate impurity for multiple outputs?
3. [📚] What are the advantages of multi-output trees?
4. [📚] How do you handle different types of outputs (continuous and categorical)?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 2: Multi-Output Trees](L6_8_2_explanation.md).

## Question 3

### Problem Statement
Online learning trees can be updated incrementally with new data.

#### Task
1. [🔍] How does online learning differ from batch learning?
2. [🔍] What are the challenges of updating decision trees online?
3. [🔍] How do you handle concept drift in online trees?
4. [🔍] What are the advantages of online learning for decision trees?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 3: Online Learning Trees](L6_8_3_explanation.md).

## Question 4

### Problem Statement
Tree visualization is important for understanding and interpreting decision trees.

#### Task
1. [📚] What are the main components of a decision tree visualization?
2. [📚] How do you represent different types of splits in a visualization?
3. [📚] What information should be displayed at each node?
4. [📚] How do you handle very deep or wide trees in visualization?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 4: Tree Visualization](L6_8_4_explanation.md).

## Question 5

### Problem Statement
Consider different advanced decision tree applications:

| Application | Tree Type | Key Challenge |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| Time series forecasting | Regression | Temporal dependencies |
| Multi-label classification | Multi-output | Label correlations |
| Streaming data | Online | Concept drift |
| High-dimensional data | Feature selection | Curse of dimensionality |

#### Task
1. [📚] **Application A**: How would you adapt trees for time series data?
2. [📚] **Application B**: How would you handle label correlations in multi-label trees?
3. [📚] **Application C**: What strategies help with concept drift in streaming data?
4. [📚] **Application D**: How do you address dimensionality issues in high-dimensional trees?

For a detailed explanation of this question, see [Question 5: Advanced Applications](L6_8_5_explanation.md).
