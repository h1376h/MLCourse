# Lecture 6: Decision Trees

## Overview
This module introduces decision tree learning algorithms, from basic concepts to advanced techniques. You'll learn how decision trees make decisions by recursively partitioning the feature space, explore algorithms like ID3 and C4.5, understand entropy and information gain in the tree context, and learn about overfitting, underfitting, pruning, and ensemble methods like Random Forest.
