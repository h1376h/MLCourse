## Prerequisites

This repository requires the following Python packages:
```
matplotlib>=3.10.1
numpy>=2.2.3
scipy>=1.15.2
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ML.git
   cd ML
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. For the best experience with the notes, install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and open the `ML_Obsidian_Vault` as a vault.

## Usage

- Open the Obsidian vault in `ML_Obsidian_Vault` and start with `course.md` for a structured learning path
- **Recommended**: Use `course.md` as your primary resource with its organized questions, examples, and slide references
- Run code examples from the `ML_Obsidian_Vault/Code` directory
- Use lecture materials as reference for deeper understanding
- Store your personal notes and slides in the appropriate directories that are ignored by git
